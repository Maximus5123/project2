“I’m not in charge of contraceptives”
“I can see that”

Had me cracking up Processed
Strauss and Oppenheimer both being served career implosions at the same exact time to represent mutually assured destruction was genius. Processed
“Maybe they were talking about something more… important”

What a great “go fuck yourself” moment. All the self-importance just gone. RDJ killed it in this role Processed
Academy award "Best Actor" winners Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman and Remi Malek have total screen time of about 5 minutes. Processed
Some guy in front of me went for a bathroom break with 15 minutes left. He sat there for 2h45m but just couldn’t make it. Brutal timing lol Processed
Oppenheimer: I’m so conflicted about my creation. Ah and angst of genius!

Teller: you know this is just the fuse for a bigger bomb I wanted to make Processed
My brother said that Gary Oldman just needs to play Stalin now and he’ll have played all three world leaders who were at Potsdam. 

Nolan seriously pulled every string possible for casting in this. It’s amazing how he knew how all of the people he’s worked with before in their secondary roles would be able to fit together into the puzzle, but that’s part of what makes his films enjoyable. David Krumholtz’s physical transformation caught me off guard, and Rami Malek having no lines until the (verbal) bomb drops at the end was outstanding. Processed
Casey Affleck was terrifying in the small screen time we saw him.

Got Sociopathic CIA vibes from his character Processed
The ending scene tying back into the raindrops hit me so damn hard. Good job Nolan you are the man, never stop making movies. Processed
My man Gödel talking about the structure of trees while everybody's trying to blow the world up was my favourite part of the film. Processed
Normal people during sex: Oh yeah oh baby

Nerds during sex: I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds Processed
I liked Kitty’s line of “you don’t get to sin and make everyone feel sorry for you.” After he found out Tatlock died Processed
“Don’t let that crybaby back in.” Holy shit Truman was an asshole. He was on screen for less than 5 minutes and was somehow the worst person in the movie. Processed
The scene after the bomb goes off and he’s addressing the crowd will haunt me for some time, I can’t remember feeling so uncomfortable in a theatre. I can’t wait to see it again, absolutely incredible spectacle from start to finish Processed
Florence Pugh showed up and got naked, then killed herself. That scene where Oppie’s wife is imagining Pugh just riding her husband, that was something I never thought I’d see in a Nolan film. It was almost Ari Aster like. Processed
"I believe we did"

Those final shots just made my heart sink. Even knowing the history I wasn't prepared to be so emotionally drained after this. Processed
I love the use of ripples on water to represent nuclear bombings like how they have drawn the blast radiuses on the map. In the end, during Einstein and Oppenheimer's encounter, it was drizzling, and endless ripples formed on the lake. Processed
Emily Blunt’s character answering questions from Roger Robb and not falling for any of his bullshit was a great scene. Processed
The feeling in my theater was palpable after the Trinity Test was successful and everyone on the ground was cheering its success. I don’t know how to describe it but it was kind of out of body to see almost a time capsule of people from 80 years ago celebrating the creation of something that could be the death of myself or my children in the future. Really chilling scene. Processed
“Do you want them to tar and feather you in the hopes they’ll forgive you for what you’ve done?”

Emily Blunt delivering the most scathing condemnation of Oppenheimer’s character and actions was so fucking powerful. Mix that in with her portrayal of postpartum depression, a mother and wife resigned to be nothing but a caretaker in the shadow of an ego driven, neurotic, anxiety filled genius and then a powerhouse fighter in the hearing, I think she was a real highlight for me. 

The film was way more humanising of Oppenheimer then I was thinking it’d be but also so much more damning of him than I’d ever thought it would be. Processed
“Maybe they weren’t talking about you at all… maybe something, more important” leading up to the final scene was a great line. The wince from Downey as the door opens and he’s hit with the sound of the reporters waiting to tear him down further. Processed
Ends with American Prometheus realizing the full scope of what still may come to pass.

This movie was fantastic. RDJ gave one hell of a fucking performance in the final act of the movie. As did everyone, regardless of their screen time throughout. Cillian Murphy conveyed so much through his role id be surprised if he didn't win best actor. Emily Blunt gave one hell of a performance and the shot of her reliving her husband's infidelity during the clearance interview was artistically beautiful. A great "show, don't tell" moment.

The fact that the pace starts and never really never let's up, but has moments of built tension that doesn't release, and moves on to save for later, makes it feel like it also never speeds up either. Its a marathon, but its paced so well its like you were trained for that marathon. My body felt the three hour run time, but my mind didn't. 

The ending was also beautiful shot, from almost every aspect. RDJ slowly making his way towards Oppenheimer and Einstein, to the content of that teased conversation, to the way it ended. Processed
Why did Nolan tease JFK like the joker card from Batman Begins Processed
Haven’t seen anyone talk about Matt Damon yet…I think he did an incredible job Processed
The last scene with Oppenheimer and Einstein made my stomach launch into my throat Processed
Emily Blunt's character where it looks like she's starting to break down and the sudden 180 during the questioning was amazing. Standing her ground and not falling for bait questions. Processed
Like many people the ending to this movie is absolutely incredible! Ending with Einstein & Oppenheimer was genius and it gave me literal chills! Nolan’s best in years Processed
For a 3 hour heavy dialogue film to have this type of speed to it is incredible. Honestly it was hard to distinguish where scenes began and ended with it's editing and pacing. It just did not stop and I loved it. It cuts to a single shot for a split second, then back to the scene, then forward to another, then backwards again while in colour for a first person perspective then to a black and white objective perspective with the music swelling along while all being coherent. Processed
The scene where Strauss is told something along the lines of "Maybe they were talking about more IMPORTANT things" had me grinning ear to ear. Oh my god Processed
Question about the scene where >! A character drowns themselves in a bathtub, was there certain shots in this sequence that showed another pair of hands drowning them ? IE implying it could’ve been murder ? !< 

Anyway, enjoyed the film, reminded me a lot of Oliver Stones ‘Nixon’ that I love.. it’s missing Stones sense of paranoia though Processed
I believe we did. 💀 Processed
Didn't know Josh Peck was going to be in it, that was a funny and pleasant surprise Processed
That scene after the bombs have been dropped and Oppenheimer is addressing that classroom of people was one of the most haunting things I’ve seen. The way the background shook, and the flash burned the audience, mixed with the silence was something else. Processed
The biggest thing for me was, just how impactful the first explosion was to the people that were there doing the testing.

They weren’t just creating another bomb, but something terrifying, world ending stuff. 

Nolan really gets that across to the audience. Impactful stuff.

But the size of the explosion threw me off. Because you see stuff [like this](https://youtu.be/NofLHhxHwYk) and the close up shots of the buildings being destroyed, [like this](https://youtu.be/DXg2P9dx-GM).


But to realize a nuclear explosion is just [this](https://youtu.be/8PJEpeU00eU) when viewed from afar, I can now totally see the scale Nolan was going for. It never really occurred to me just how almost simple the explosion could be portrayed, I never put a lot of thought into it. But it’s still so horrifying in its destructiveness. Processed
I was genuinely surprised when I saw Rami Malek. Didn't know he was here. Processed
Ludwig Göransson might be approaching a Hans Zimmer level of film composer. The way he orchestrated the score adds so much to the tension and anxiety of the movie. Hopefully he picks up the Oscar Processed
For the physics folks here, Feynman and his repeated scenes with the bongos cracked me up. Jokes aside, Nolan outdid himself and it lived up to the hype for me. Processed
It’s hilarious that the nude scene that everybody made so much out of even included the Destroyer of Worlds Bhagavad Gita quote. Processed
Anyone else catch the black gloved hand in the corner of the frame during the tatlock “suicide” scene? In the Bird/Sherwon book there is a suggestion that she was murdered. I thought this was an interesting way of visualizing the ambiguous circumstances of her death. Processed
I found Emily Blunt's portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer particularly compelling and it was amazing how complete a character she was in such limited time. During her limited screentime she showed:

* Vulnerability - post partum depression

* Compassion - Robert tells her about Jean

* Determination - telling Robert to fight

* Wisdom - reasoned it was Strauss

* Strength - the only one that really made Roger Robb struggle Processed
One thing I think I missed during the movie was in the beginning when they brought the titles for:
1. Fission
2. Fusion

I thought this would come back and it didn’t. Anyone have an understand of what that meant? Does it have to do something with the color vs black and white. Could have missed something really basic. Processed
No one talking about him,

But Jason Clarke as Roger Robb in the interrogation scenes was genuinely brilliant. Just such an amazing performance all round from the whole cast. Processed
The dead silence in the theater during the trinity explosion. Something I’ll never forget experiencing in a full theater. Processed
They played the trailer to The Exorcist Believer before this movie 🤣 Processed
I loved how that constant stomping noise is used to make you feel terror, you’re afraid anytime you hear it and then it’s revealed that the terrifying sound, is a crowd of people cheering for Oppenheimer. It makes it even more scary Processed
Christopher Nolan has perfectly encapsulated what anxiety can feel like. Claustrophobic, loud, and unrelenting. Processed
Our 70mm showing stopped working 2.5 hours into the film! A light bulb or something broke. We had a little 10 min intermission, and got free tickets bc of it! Overall one of Nolan's best films. Processed
He always answered because there was no caller ID back then. Processed
No, Strauss, you’re not important enough to be discussed by Oppenheimer and Einstein. Processed
Cillian Murphy's haunting look at several key points of the film is just amazing. That final conversation with Einstein, his stare is immense and powerful Processed
Did anyone else notice that when Strauss is retelling the story of Oppenheimer embarrassing him, he laughs along with everyone else, but later in the movie when they show it, he’s completely stone-faced. Processed
Seen it twice now already. Trinity test scene was remarkable and what most people will see the film for, but there are so many other great scenes. Some of my favorite:

- **"Can you hear the music, Robert?"** The scene where Oppenheimer is told to leave Cambridge and we seem him abroad, looking at art, thinking of the quantum world, all while the beautiful score is played. Such a beautiful montage. It happens early so it's somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes, but make no mistake I think it's one of the best in the film.

- The dinner with Strauss, where they are discussing whether or not there was a spy at Los Alamos and if the Soviets have an H-bomb. I love this sequence, I love the way the music swells, the back and forth between Strauss and Oppenheimer, and how the scene ends with Oppenheimer says something to the effect of "there was no spy" and Strauss holds up the data sheet and says "Robert." RDJ delivery of that line was like music. I love how everything was played during that scene and how it all culminates with RDJ's delivery of that line. 

- **"I'm taking Kyoto off the list, due to it's cultural significance to the Japanese people. Also my wife and I honeymooned there."** Fantastic and harrowing scene where they discuss how and where to effectively use the bomb. James Remar is particularly great. 

- The gymnasium scene, after they learned of the Horishima bombing. This was Nolan directing a horror film. First of all I loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene, as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field, resulting in a dream like/nightmare like appearance. This might be Cillian's best scene in the film, watching Oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd, as the reality around him begins to break down, as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in. I love how flat his "rah-rah" speech is. And the use of sound here is tremendous. The stamping of the feet, the sound of the crowd going out, the sound of a woman screaming, the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself. 

- The whole last hour is great, but the sequence where Roger Robb is realllyyy starting to grill Oppenheimer and the blinding light begins to fill the room. Acting and editing here was just unreal. 

- The scene with Pash. Casey Affleck's line delivery is so soft spoken, yet unsettling. Really tense scene.

- **"You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do"** I loved that this film used a Rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity. One of my favorites was the scene where Oppenheimer "humiliates" Strauss in public over the isotopes. I love when we first see this scene, Strauss appears to take Oppenheimer's jabs with good humor, smiling and shrugging it off, but when the true nature of Strauss is revealed near the end of the film, we see this sequence again, and Strauss looks so angry and humiliated. Also Cillian's line delivery during these moments were so good. I just love how he says "in fact you do!"



- The final scene where we learn what Oppenheimer and Einstein really said to each other that day. Nolan understands set up and pay off so well. You watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint. The final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust, is incredibly bleak, but much of what Einstein says to Oppenheimer during before this is so sad and god damn poignant. Watching Oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to. The way Einstein sums up the burden of genius, but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age. Processed
Rami Malek's character (Hill?) was basically the opposite of Strauss. Strauss is met with two minor slights by Oppenheimer, one imagined, and makes it his mission to ruin his life. 

Hill was genuinely dismissed, maybe even bullied, by Oppenheimer multiple times but years later decides to essentially exonerate him in front of a congressional hearing. Processed
A film that feels like an enormous pop culture event while simultaneously being a 3 hour, dialogue heavy character study that extensively uses black and white photography. Watching such a film on a massive screen with a sold out crowd is honestly quite unbelievable. In this day in age we almost exclusively expect this for comic book movies and not much else. That thought alone genuinely brought me to the verge of tears multiple times. We just don’t get moments like this very often. Thankfully Oppenheimer is worthy of the moment. Processed
He was so mean/dismissive to Rami’s character and yet he was the one who supported and back him up Processed
I knew nothing of the history between Oppenheimer and RDJ’s real life counterpart he was playing. So when in the 3rd act it’s revealed he’s the one orchestrating the campaign to ruin Cillian Murphy, I was STUNNED.

Legit the best twist I seen since LA confidential. Processed
I'm just gonna say that the bowls on the table filling up with marbles might be low-key one of my favorite plot devices. 

Most films would give some stupid exposition, try and explain something really fucking complex like bending a piece of paper and poking a hole through it or something. 

Not this film. Nolan just shows marbles filling in some bowls and keeps the film focused on what fucking matters. Brilliant. Processed
The way my sphincter exploded like the bomb when the audio cuts back in during the gymnasium applause. Processed
The last 30 minutes could be its own movie lol, Oppenheimer getting slammed from everyone Processed
They made a avengers assemble movie for all the scientists but didn’t give them each solo movies to flesh out their characters. Also that Einstein guy seems like some bait for a prequel movie Processed
That little mention of JFK voting against Strauss got a good chuckle out of me Processed
I love how Nolan played with the differences between the speed of light and sound during the Trinity Test. To convey an awe-inspiring visual spectacle only to be engulfed by the force/sound of it. 

The atomic bomb was a marvelous scientific achievement but then the magnitude of this creation and the harm it will cause literally hits you like a freight train. 

My whole theater was completely silent. It was awesome to be a part of. Processed
The Soundwave after the detonation was a genuine jump scare in my screening last night. If felt like my packed Theater was all together in wonder at the explosion visuals that the blast sound shocked everyone back to reality. Processed
I fucking loved this movie. So much tragedy in this movie. Love Emily Blunts line that went something like just because you sin don't expect the world to feel sorry for you. Of course all the conversations with Einstein were great. 
Loved RDJ in the third act
Pacing and editing is so great.
I held my piss in the whole time.
Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt need Oscar nods IMO.
Nolan did it again Processed
It’s funny to think that the whole barbenheimmer trend is going to convince more than one casual film goer to see a three hour dialogue heavy biopic. It’s very good, Cillian Murphy is phenomenal, RDJ kinda hijacks in the third act but that’s alright I like him too, love Gary oldman’s new schtick of “I’m going to cover myself in some much rubber that even my mama won’t recognize me” Processed
I don’t think it can be understated how powerful that last scene between Einstein and Oppenheimer was. I was already blown away by the film but that scene will haunt me for the rest of my life. 10/10. Processed
Everyone praising Murphy and RDJ

Y'all 

Damon was excellent. Processed
Had to cancel my tickets for Barbie after, this was intense Processed
Here are my main takeaways:
- There were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time. Several names I recognized from textbooks that I didn’t realize knew each other and worked together. It could be because I’m not actively studying scientific journals, but it seems like we don’t have as many Einsteins, Bohrs, and Oppenheimers these days. 
- The movie had way more political undertones than I was expecting. Really highlighted that some of the madness we see in politics has existed for centuries. Processed
The 5 minutes leading up to the bomb going off had my heart racing Processed
The thing that makes this movie incredible is I don't even know where to start with it. Albert Einstein is in just a few scenes and on film for what 5 minutes and the portrayal is amazing and wonderful and heartwarming. There's not a single bad performance in the movie. 

Oldman as Truman is awesome and bold because all Nolan does is portray Truman as he was. If you know history you know Truman is a good man/president and yet he comes off as a total asshole. It's remarkable. 

Downey and Murphy are 10/10. But so are so many others. Blunt is superb. Branaugh is in 2 scenes basically and he's effing incredible. 

The question of if we are doomed is so dark but powerful. And the way the movie used oppenheimer's imagination as surrealism and connects it back to him looking at art is...whew. it's just an awesome, awesome piece of art (the movie I mean). 

I'm a history teacher and I try to convey to students how big a deal the bomb is. It really is a break with the rest of our history as a species and arguably the most important thing we've ever done. It will either destroy us or send us total the stars. This movie summed up all my efforts at teaching this subject and then some. Processed
More serious blockbuster summer movies that are for adults please Processed
So the 15 minute full penetration sex scene… was not true… Processed
I really gotta read all three volumes of *Das Kapital* in the original German so I can impress a cute psychiatrist at the next communist party I attend. Processed
Everyone acted their asses off in this movie but I will continue to think about Emily Blunt and RDJ's performances. Simply amazing.

Did anyone catch who played Truman? I think it was some nobody who's never been in a movie before... Processed

This movie has possibly created a world record by having the most number of Nobel Laureates on screen. (I counted atleast 10). Processed
In my personal opinion the part that's meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering, but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes. A crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb. The movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction. So when he sees people drunk on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of drunk on power. Oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime, but when Truman blew him off and basically said I'm God, oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end. Probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 

Why the ending scene with Einstein should haunt you, is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here. We are the chain reaction, that's when Einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics. So the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away. Makes you think about who you are voting for, how much tech you use, and how we use AI

The movie was a 10/10. But as an engineer that studied nuclear energy I am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved (it was like the art rennisance but for science, the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex. quantum computing in the age of AI)  I already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man. Maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace. Brilliant character study of one of the world's most interesting people. He felt the music, he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher Devine purpose. Processed
Every single casting choice was on the fucking point. Processed
- Arguably one of Nolan’s tightest scripts. It felt concise for what it was trying to do, and has hardly any filler scenes. 

- RDJ was incredible. I liked how he was kind of Tony Stark-ish at first, and then he becomes more and more unlikable as it goes on. He’s the front runner for Supporting Actor this year, for sure.

- Matt Damon was an unsung highlight. He was hilarious, and always gave great line deliveries.

- Gary Oldman as Truman was a great cameo. He was such a prick in only 2 minutes of screen time.

- The Trinity Test scene was absolutely breathtaking. The tension, followed by the silence, followed by the sound was thrilling to experience.

- Holy shit, that scene with Oppenheimer giving the speech in the gym and he hallucinates the bomb going off on the crowd. Genuinely one of the most haunting scenes I’ve ever seen.

- The score was fantastic, Ludwig deserves a ton of credit for building up the intensity with his score. Processed
I'm glad Nolan restrained himself from showing Hiroshima. Instead he showed Murphy's face who is emoting all the dread and remorse pretty well. The post Hiroshima speech is an all-timer scene. Processed
3 hours of people just... talking. And I could have watched another 3 hours. What an incredible movie. Processed
I haven’t seen many comments on the score, Ludwig Göransson absolutely killed it. Love the string motif. Processed
During the scene with the bomb, I couldn't help but think how funny it would be if something went wrong and Josh Peck was forced to push the red button... Look up with a thousand yard stare and say... "Megan..." Processed
I watched the movie, I felt like this is the best Christopher Nolan movies in years, it felt massive with so many actors in here and yet felt intimate because, this movie peeled the layer of Oppenheimer that we've never seen before on big screen, Cillian Murphy stepped in to a lead role and he executed that so precisely, RDJ also gave memorable performance as Strauss, the antagonist for Oppenheimer.

I also felt like Nolan is firing on all cylinders in here, camera works, sound designs, score, script were all top notch. Processed
If I’m a Hollywood male actor under the age of 80 and I wasn’t in this movie, I’m calling my agent first thing tomorrow Processed
"For I have become Josh Peck, the destroyer of worlds" Processed
I just want to say, as a physicist I enjoyed the first half hourish of the movie immensely. The jokes about mathematics, experimental vs theoretical, and Oppenheimer staring at a board saying “yep that proves it” really tickled my fancy. Processed
[deleted] Processed
My favourite part was when Einstein showed up from behind a car like Master Oogway Processed
That Truman scene was harrowing.

Also Casey Affleck was scary as fuck. Processed
I'm sorry, but the first sex scene where THE LINE is read aloud was absolutely ridiculous.

The rest of the movie, 10/10.

Edit:

"Talk dirty to me Opie!"

"I HAVE BECOME DEATH THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS" Processed
Very excited to watch Nolan finally take home all the Oscars Processed
The trinity test is the biggest reverse card Nolan played on the audience ever.

Everybody was excited for the sound of the explosion and it turns out, the waiting in anxiety for 30 seconds for the sound to hit was the heaviest experience I ever had in a theatre. 300 people dead quiet, you see the explosion, you stop breathing, sweating, 30 seconds feel like 5 minutes.

I had a mini panic attack waiting for the explosion sound and at that point we did not care if the exposion was loud enough, we only cared for those 30 seconds of total silence, sweat and anxiety in hearing the detonation. Processed
My screening is about to start and apparently lots of parents didn't get the memo it's an R rated movie and brought their kids. I had Florence Pugh's titties being shown spoiled for me so this should be interesting. Will update.

Update: surprisingly not too big a deal, tamer than I thought it would be. Maybe some covered eyes from the parents but not 100% sure since the theater was dark. Processed
When they were counting down to the explosion, some dumbass shouted allahu akbar when i guess he assumed there would be a loud explosion. This was at the IMAX showing at the SF Metreon. Processed
One of the best parts that’s not directly movie related was the exact start time and no movie previews, at least for the IMAX 70mm shows. This should be standard if you watch any PLF (IMAX, Dolby Cinema etc). As for the movie, definitely the front runner for Best Picture and acting nods for Cillian Murphy and RDJ. Hope this leads to more lead roles for Murphy. Processed
The thing that stands out to me the most is how well the film portrays Oppenheimer as a truly complex character that remains sympathetic throughout. A really great performance from Cillian Murphy and an excellent narrative. 

I also loved the string theory visuals. They felt very real in a way that’s hard to describe even though it’s probably not scientifically accurate/known. Processed
I’m a fan of Nolan. I was so blown away, like many I imagine, the first time I saw *The Prestige* it changed how I viewed movies. I stuck with him through the years, and was continued to be blown away. 

*Oppenheimer* is a larger than life film. Certainly seeing it in IMAX 70mm influenced that feeling, but the film truly felt massive. The non-linear storytelling painted a world so complex and big. The cinematography not only enlarged the characters on the screen, but it amplified the consequences of their actions. The score was perfect. It never missed a beat, and the moments when you were thrown into silence was beautifully garnished by the sound of the projector clicking away over my shoulder. 

I know I’m not going to form a fully unbiased opinion on the film 10 minutes after coming out of my first 70mm IMAX showing in 6 years, so maybe I’ll save that for another time. But what I do want to say:

* The acting was phenomenal. Everybody just melted into their characters so well. RDJ was so great. He was so fucking great. 
* The story also worked well. I liked the ever-present theme of the movie where Oppenheimer was making all decisions rationally, and the others in his life would be corrupted by selfishness, pride, or power. Not to say that’s how it actually was, but it worked as a lens to view through the eyes of Oppenheimer. Nolan made a big deal of the fact he wrote this in the first person, and it showed. 
* I can see why some people preferred the first 2/3s of the movie and didn’t like the last 3rd as much. I still liked the climax and conclusion of the film, especially the ending with Einstein, but that may be something I reconsider when I’m less biased. The non-linear storyline worked, but perhaps it could have been better edited differently. 

Anyway. I’m super happy I got to see it in IMAX 70mm. I’m seeing it again that way on Saturday and will likely return for all the other filmstrip souvenirs. I don’t want analog projections to die and am glad this movie was so good since it makes a great case for it. Processed
I thoroughly enjoyed the endless list of bit players in this.

The guy from Numbers, the guy from Band of Brothers and Han Solo working for Strauss, Lucky Number Slevin, Freddie Mercury, the glasses guy from Full Metal Jacket, the Joker's henchman in The Dark Knight, that Hereditary guy... Processed
That scene with Oppenheimer giving speech, while background rumbles and shake is too good Processed
[deleted] Processed
The last scene of the flashbacks near the lake was just incredible. It culminates the entire debate and emotions of nuclear technology used as weapons.

First flashback the audience is made to believe Einstein is upset at Oppenheimer. Second flashback looks like Einstein is upset at Strauss. Final flashback we understand Einstein was upset at himself. It’s the whole debate of who do we blame for everything surrounding nuclear technology. Do we blame the theorist (Einstein), the creator (Oppenheimer), or the user (Strauss). We see all three conflicts in 3 flashbacks to that one scene. Just brilliant. Processed
Don’t know why but Einstein suddenly appearing after the taxi pulled away cracked me up. He was like the hype superhero cameo showing up once an act lol Processed
My wife and I really liked the film. We're Asians who were invaded by the Japanese during the war and seeing the leadup to the trinity test and the explosion was a very emotional experience for us, so much so that my wife wept knowing how much it had actually affected our history; both for good and bad.  


I also really liked how Einstein was like a magical Wizard in the movie throwing some sage advice from time to time. Processed
The speech where he begins to walk around the ashes of the people who were nuked was really fucked up, and the Trinity test scene was intense to the point where you could hear a pin drop while everybody was watching the test beginning.


The last 10 to 15 minutes are probably some of RDJ's best acting i've ever seen, absolutely goosebump worthy performances all around Processed
Jason Clarke was so hateable in this. Very frustrating character but goddamn what a performance. Processed
Marvel style JFK name drop cracked me up so much.  I think I've over-consumed capeshit Processed
Can’t believe that when Oppenheimer found his catchphrase he was looking at tiddies, that’s crazy Processed
That ending was a real kick in the pants. What a line. When Oppenheimer was like "I'm here to see my gynecologist" Processed
I liked how the script incorporated a lot of small things that get passed around as part of legend, like how Kyoto was crossed off the target list because Henry Stimson had a honeymoon there, the student who dramatically interrupted his haircut to go tell Oppenheimer about the successful nuclear fission experiment he read in the paper, the poisoned apple, the making a bet on total ignition of the Atmosphere, and so on, but I was surprised there wasn't a scene about Fermi accurately estimating the yield of the Trinity test with just some tiny papers, the wind, and educated guesses. Can't include it all I suppose.

The way the movie first incorporated the famous "I am become Death..." line felt for lack of a better word *tacky*. Processed

Am I over thinking the scene with Jean where they talk about the Bhagavad-Gita?

In the scene in which Jean (Florence Pugh) asks him to read from the Bhagavad-Gita, he starts by trying to explain the context that Arjuna finds himself, but Jean says she wants him to read the words. So he does, "I am become death, destroyer of worlds".

I don't know if any of you have read the Bhagavad Gita, but the context Oppenheimer is trying to give is that Arjuna doesn't want to commit to war against his kin, but Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) convinces Arjuna that it is his dharma (i.e. "duty") to wage war.

The fact that Jean tells him to stop explaining the broader moral quandary that Arjuna finds himself in, and just read the words, seems similar to the expectations laid on him within the military context. It also, of course, reflects broader ideas around "duty".

Edit: I welcome any criticisms of my thoughts from members of the Hindu community. It has been a long time since I read the Bhagavad-Gita, and I'm going from memory. Processed

The similarity of Oppenheimer to The Social Network is insane to me.

- A relatively popular A-list cast that is performing at their peek.

- A very fast-paced script with little to no breathing room that build up tension as the film progresses.

- A bombastic sound mixing that makes your heart hum to the drum.

- Two key characters that have to deal with the consequences of their brilliances.

The way the bomb scene was done was unexpected but amazing. So silent. You don't know what is coming next after the countdown, but you know it'll be something on a majestic scale. 3... 2... 1... and.... silence? You could just feel the weight and meaning behind the images that you get after that, hearing your own heart beat and the breathing of everyone around you in the theater... and then BOOM.

Just wow, what a movie. I'm going to go ahead and look more into Oppenheimer's life now. Processed
Just got out of the theater. Watched in 70mm. The most incredible part of this movie is how it's 3 hours with never ending dialogues and literally no action and it keeps you engaged the whole time. Godly story pacing. I did not expect the silence in the Trinity Test but the amazing part of that was the whole theater was straight up silent too. You obviously see them cheering in the movie, but for us, the audience, we know what terrible consequences this bomb development has caused and, God forbid, potentially may cause.

 Thought all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job, Murphy, Downey, Damon, and Blunt. Love how little CGI was used, and it was refreshing to just see amazing cinematography, acting, and storytelling carry the movie.

There was this one scene where Albert Einstein appears out of fucking nowhere from behind a car that I found really funny. Processed
The fact Oppenheimer took down Strauss with him at the end was a nice reference to the scorpion allegory. He basically atomic bombed him. Processed
The very last scene of the movie makes it clear that Strauss’s beef with Oppenheimer (that he turned Einstein against him) was based on a misunderstanding.  

Did Nolan intend this as an allegory for nuclear war starting based on a misunderstanding? Especially as the war between these two ends with mutual career destruction. Processed

Really impressed by this movie. Not just because it's so visually stunning or because of all the incredible performances, but because this full three hour movie that is mostly made up of people talking or being deposed is gripping the entire time. The score and the editing keep this thing pumping and it's nothing short of awesome how this movie keeps you invested. 

Just a very impressive movie top to bottom. When it comes to the performances I was stricken by so many. Like, Emily Blunt is incredible in this movie but she's like the fifth best performance. Cillian, Damon, Pugh, RDJ, Safdie, they're all absolutely killing it. 

But the heavy lifting Oppenheimer does is propelled so much by the score. This is a lot of scenes of people just talking, but the way it's put together and backed by this in-your-face pulse pounding score you'd think it's some sort of action thriller. But really it's just a movie about chain reactions, about cause and effect. 

It isn't just a bunch of random scenes that tell the story of Oppenheimer, it's a tower that leads to the end of the world, and every brick is built on a moment or relationship that came before it. That's what really kept this thing moving is very rarely was I feeling like something was unnecessary or out of context. Everything in this movie seems to be a direct result of something that happened moments or years before.

It's such classic Nolan to play with the timelines like this, to shake them up and reveal things in multiple scenes at the same time. But what I really loved about this movie is how timelines would catch up to each other or how we would eventually see or hear about a scene multiple times from multiple points of view by the end of it. Ending it with that Oppenheimer/Einstein scene felt absolutely perfect because the movie had me wondering what happened there the entire time. And Alden Ehrenreich being quietly one of the best performances in this movie had that absolute banger of a line "Maybe it's possible they were talking about something *more important*."

Speaking of that scene, I know this isn't going to be an unpopular take, but RDJ was unreal in this movie. Not doing his normal thing at all, almost unrecognizable, yet the third act of this seems him as the surprise antagonist and the way he plays it is so fucking good. That subtle insecurity when we first see Oppenheimer mock him in public and the way it obviously had him fucking seething inside but we don't see how much until later, yet it was there in his performance the whole movie. Absolutely masterful stuff. 

Yall, it's an easy 9/10. I can't wait to see it again on an even bigger screen just letting those speakers raw dog my ears.

The mechanics of every scene mimics that of a  chain reaction, at the start I was unnerved by the staccato nature of the scenes and the dialogue, but by the end you can see that each interaction and consequence is related to the theme of entropy. There is also the subjective perspective of personal memory, which can be surreal at times juxtaposed with the chaos of objectivity…outlined by both the colour shots and the b/w shots. You can see the thread from memento, inception, interstellar and tenet on time, entropy, thermal dynamics, chaos and the human psyche linked to place in it all. Wonderfully captured by the excellent scene where he throwing crystal glasses destructively into the corner of the room. Every time we are in the company of a baby, we hear screaming. Processed
Watched Barbie, then started the 9:10pm showing of Oppenheimer at the the Regal UA in Langhorne, PA. Halfway through (when Oppenheimer tells Groves he lied about Chevalier to Pash), the film reel caught fire and the whole theater evacuated. Great! 🤪 Will have to watch again tomorrow. Processed

Probably pretty obvious to most but I was struck how the metaphor Oppenheimer delivers of the two scorpions in mutually assured destruction also accurately describes himself and Strauss. Processed
Loved it but it's not for everyone. It left me with a grave sense of anguish and I would say even trauma, but in a good way.  
I'm still baffled at how Nolan managed to put so much information in a 3h movie with mostly dialogues and still made it incredibly interesting and action-driven.  
I'd say that the part I loved the most is the last one with Einstein, that was alone 10/10. Processed
So, first of all…right off the bat. This movie is absolutely fucking incredible.

The pace was perfect, the cast was amazing and captured the emotions of the scene at hand almost perfectly. Josh Hartnett is still a heart throb, RDJ was unrecognizable yet still captivating every second he was on screen. And Cillian Murphy, my fucking lord is he an incredible actor. The way this man can turn his face into being composed, yet absolutely terrified at the same time. His eyes in this movie alone should win its own Oscar for best supporting actor.

Nolan really outdid himself, but this man really needs to learn how to better soundmix his movies. There are so many times on screen where I wished there were closed captions because you have actors using thick accents trying to talk over the background music, which made it incredibly difficult to understand at a few separate points in the movie.

But that test scene was absolutely incredible, and is up there with one of my favorite scenes to see in a movie theater. I’m glad I sat in a Dolby Theatre. Processed
When the bomb finally went off, I sat there thinking, wait, there's no audio? Then I was like well ... I guess if they're 10 miles away and sounds travels at 340m/s, the observers must have stood there for 30-40 seconds before hearing the... \*booooooooom\*

On a broader note, I thought it was interesting that there were scenes out on the ranch in Los Alamos where I got that same spine tingling feeling that I did watching Interstellar. It felt very much like a Nolan affair.

Ultimately, gotta say that Nolan absolutely nailed it on this one. Extremely glad that I went and saw it in 70mm - this is definitely one to see in the Cinemas. Processed
The best moments of the film were the moments leading up to the Trinity test. I felt the tension through my whole body and just wondered what it would've been like to have spent years of your life working towards one moment and being able to see how it unfolds in front of your own eyes. And all of that followed by the silence when the bomb actually went off until the sound of the the sonic boom hits your ears and you get to see the euforia of the scientists afterwards who had just decided the fate of humankind for decades to follow without knowing it at the time. Simply outstanding.

Edit: Grammar and phrasing. Processed

A lot of movies criticism is the third act sucks but with this movie it was the opposite, I enjoyed the third act (post Trinity test) the most, best part of the movie was seen Oppenheimer grapple with his guilt as well as RDJ scenes. I also especially liked Oppenheimer scene with Truman, Gary Oldman short apperance in the movie stole the show. It's funny also how Nolan treated Kennedy like a marvel teaser when he was mentioned (like what he did with Robin in DKR) Processed
It was a good film.

I went in with 0 expectations of actually seeing THE two nuclear bombs in Japan so I wasn't disappointed when that didn't happen.

Nolan's choice of having Oppenheimer sit through the presentation of the horrors of the aftermath but not showing us what Oppie is seeing was effective in creating dread without showing it. Processed
Heard a lot of chatter about poor representation of women in the film before it’s release, but after watching it I honestly don’t think that’s was the case, not that I’m any expert on the subject. 

Florence Pugh’s character got very little screen time but her role was impactful and tragic. On the other hand, Emily Blunt was fantastic. She went from a reserved and quiet character serving as further exposition of Oppie’s life, who seemingly would have a very small role, into an extremely animated character with a lot of gravitas. Her cold rage grew as she watched Oppie cheat throughout the years, and while she rightfully let some of it boil over onto him, it truly showed its face as she displayed the anger and vindictiveness I expected out of Oppie himself during his political crucifixion. It seemed that in the aftermath of his political blacklisting that Oppie was extremely reserved and almost resigned, no doubt in part due to guilt over the Pandora’s box he opened, and the realization he had no power or platform at all to control its future course. On the other hand, Emily Blunt brings a cathartic sense of righteous anger to the whole situation which balanced with Oppie’s nearly constant broken stare and acceptance. The scene where Kitty refuses Teller’s handshake is almost as satisfying as when RDJ’s character finally gets his comeuppance. You could also see the exact moment when the dissenting judge flipped to Oppie’s side while listening to Kitty’s indignant testimony. Definitely one of my favorite characters from the film, perhaps second only to the man himself and Einstein who was awesome. Processed
Minor spoilers follow (in as much as one can have spoilers for a historical drama).

I have been thinking about this movie for two days after having seen it. Obviously a good sign. During that time I have seen commentary to the effect that the trailer is misleading.

I agree.

I thought the drama and excitement was going to come from the Manhattan project. That is what the trailer seemed to be presenting. But it didn't. It came from the interpersonal drama. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was not what I felt I had been set up to see.

Interestingly, the very few and brief scenes where the project itself is the focus carry a lot of emotional impact. The original "marbles in a jar" scene was an "oh my" moment. The occasional but recurring shots of the implosion core partially surrounded by explosives were appropriately menacing. These were great scenes, but they were few and far between.

As the movie ended I reflected on why there was so much focus on Lewis Strauss, and in the end I decided that Nolan probably wanted to give the titular character "justice" at the climax, and given the factual history, there weren't many ways to do that.

My frustrations peaked in the scenes where they described both Einstein and Oppenheimer as mathematically sub-par. This is a horrible fiction - particularly in the case of Einstein - that seems to be fed to children who aren't strong in mathematics to prevent them from feeling discouraged. But at this point it has become received wisdom and seems to be accepted generally as a historical fact. The national geographic series "Genius" promoted the same egregious fiction (amongst its many other rewritings of history, but let's not go there). No, adults ought not still believe in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny either.

Artistically the film was a technical tour de force, but challenging. For the first couple of minutes I thought we were being treated with a montage of events to put the audience into the context, and then the movie proper would begin. But scenes continued to be machine-gunned at me right up to the actual trinity explosion at which point everything comes to an abrupt halt, and the score was written in the same way. Artistically, I get it. it's a deliberate choice to make the trinity test an inflection point, not just in the plot but in the very construction of the movie. I personally felt it sacrificed too much for the eventual effect, but I respect the artistic choice.

Part of what spoiled that punctuated moment for me was the jarringly underwhelming explosion from the test. Going into the movie I wondered whether they might take historical footage and touch it up (the trailer actually does this). I expected the initial jellyfish-like fireball, so intense and massive that its barely translucent surface looks almost uniform, and a sense of scale provided by the shockwave in relation to the surrounding terrain. (Go and watch the original trinity footage to see what I mean if you've never seen it). But no, what we got was a close-up of a rolling fireball with some sparks. The kind movies often produce by setting off a detonator inside a bag of gasoline. To make matters worse, when the shockwave hit the prone observers it looked like some prop handler just off camera threw half a bucket of dirt into the scene from the left.

All that said, I still enjoyed the movie for what it was even if I felt misled by the trailer, and I did appreciate the artistry of the direction even if it didn't quite work for me personally. All of the acting was faultless, even though the amazing cast was barely given a chance to act for the first half of the movie because of the brevity of each scene. The moment when Raimi Malek says "thank you" on being offered a chance to speak (after merely 3 brief scenes for this A-list actor - during which he was very conspicuously given no lines) was a clever and subtle 4th wall breaker. And I was chuffed by a few historical easter eggs (Feynman on his bogo drums, for example).

I would like someone to explain to me what they took away from this movie, other than  the technical aspects. It looked great, the acting was top notch, and the sound design is the main star here. That's unfortunate. Unless you have an awesome sound setup at home, the best part of this movie will be lost.

The movie didn't really have much to say for me. Of course Oppenheimer was conflicted about what he created. That's a given for anyone who isn't a psychopath. 

Nolan has a problem with actually approaching human emotions. It's almost like he's afraid to, and I think it hurts his movies. They're all too cold and clinical. Processed
It finally released here in South Korea, and it was so good! Koreans generally don't learn much about Trinity and Oppenheimer in school - the country was a bit busy being severely oppressed by imperial Japan at the time it all went down. (It's the same reason World War 1 history outside Korea isn't well-known - Korea was under Japanese rule for a *long* time.) So this movie is the first time some Koreans will learn more than the basic trivia - and it does a pretty good job of teaching. I think it'll inspire a lot of Koreans to do some research and learn the true facts.

A few themes and patterns that I noticed in the movie, which may be open to interpretation, but I'll give my own. Maybe these have been discussed in this forum before or have different ways of looking at them, but I wanna give my thoughts:

&#x200B;

1) **Fusion and Fission**: The First scene starts with Fusion (black and white) and Fission (color). My first question was how are the colors related to Fission and Fusion. 

***My theory:*** 

**Fission** is splitting of atoms, or division of one thing into smaller things. The color scenes in the movie are the scenes from Oppi's perspective. This represents how he (like Prometheus) is distributing himself to the world (metaphorically speaking). This happens from different perspectives: Scientific, political and even in his humanitarian efforts later on. He just wanted to give more of himself to the world. Just like splitting an atom gives a huge amount of energy, his contribution did the same

**Fusion** on the other hand is like forcibly pushing two particles together. The black and white scenes in the movie are the facts in the movie, or shall I say, how the world perceived and reacted to Oppenheimer. This represents the opposite both in the scientific phenomena and in the movie with Oppi. The world constantly tries to push him, with his duality in his nature constantly being pushed together. It's most clear after the bomb, when the feeling of relief in the success of the bomb is juxtaposed with the horrific nature of the tragedy. Oppi constantly feels fused by various elements and to some degree, his own work in fission and fusion (another play they did in the movie)

I don't know how much of this was intended, but in any case, they really paid attention to the details for this.

&#x200B;

2. **Lack of glamour:** This has been addressed earlier by other people and my take on the fact that people feel that there were no grand explosions, or deep exploration of relationships in some cases, or the movie being long/boring; is this:

'Are you watching closely?'

The Prestige, a movie where he laid some of the foundations of what he wants to do in his movies includes his very important line. He wants you to pay attention to every single detail. Of course, this is difficult and sometimes even more so due to sound mixing issues but there are advantages to this.

First, it's a great repeat experience and second, if you understand his philosophies, the movies become a 100 times more rewarding.

In the case of Oppi, Nolan set the stage and the tone of the movie that this is NOT a movie about a hero or a villain, it's not a fictional tale. Nolan's choice of basing the event on reality includes a very important point: Perspective. He does not want you to show you the perspective you want, but the perspective that existed. 

Regardless of how underwhelming it is, that was reality. 

The emotional relationships, especially with women, was (at that time) much less important with the fear of death and war at your doorstep. 

The explosions were not heard or seen, but felt. No one saw what happened in Japan. We are privileged to see them in 2023, so we think, ah it could be better if I could see the horror and feel it. But the true horror is in the reactions, the celebrations, the paradoxes and what follows after.

The bomb was not the climax of the movie, the courtroom drama was, in my humble opinion. The whole movie was building up to how traumatic this experience is as an individual and how ruthless society is : JUST LIKE A BOMB IS.

&#x200B;

He showed the implications of the bomb by making you feel the implications of the bomb, rather than show it. He showed what it meant to be in the new world.

&#x200B;

And just like the great Robert Downey Jr's character failed to understand, so did many people, that this movie is about more than the self-importance of individuals, it's more than the self-importance of explosions and crucially more that the self-importance of Oppenheimer.  


That's all, please let me know what you think Processed
Not a comment on the film but reactions to people wishing to have seen more of the science in the film. My original trajectory in life was to be a physicist, and I made it to college with that intent, but had to drop before finishing due to illness, so seeing the parade of names in this film was incredible to me. I originally started that track after being introduced to Richard Feynman's work as a sophomore in high school. 

The reality is, theoretical physics can't be reduced into layman's terms in an easily digestible way, like many other sciences. You either lay the groundwork for understanding, or you explain it in a way that is generally wrong. I think Nolan opted to avoid it in order to prevent having to contort representations of the greatest minds the world had to offer, saying things that were flat-out incorrect. That's why there were only really broad surface statements about "a photon is both a particle and a wave" or "we can cause a cascade." Once you get beyond that point, you have to either go way to far into detail or be wildly inaccurate in your explanations. Those explanations wouldn't be something that the people in those rooms would require anyway, so that would feel weird in itself. Processed
My friends were telling me how amazing the 70mm imax viewing was. I told them i was perfectly fine with watching oppenheimer get questioned for 2 hours in 35mm Processed
"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the ~~wizard~~ confirmation hearing." - Lewis Strauss Processed
Bohr, Fermi, Lawrence, Heisenberg, Feynman, Teller, Einstein, literally everyone is here! Did anyone else get elated from this? I was half expecting Oppenheimer to be kidnapped by the Japanese only to be rescued by an elderly Planck and Pauli, breaking down a door and yelling "it's nuking time!" Processed
Not enough people are giving credit to score of this film. It was phenomenal. Perfectly encapsulates the feeling of physicist trying to come up with a theory which starts as slow and melancholic to ultimately making one of the most destructive weapons the mankind ever saw filling with how protagonist feels with regrets and power. Processed
70mm IMAX blew me away. The speakers under the seats really made a massive difference. 

The scene in the deposition that had the slow build of the music and the stomping was absolutely incredible. I got sucked into it. 

I don't think I moved for the full 3hrs. 

Also got a REALLY solid theater audience, the scene when the bomb dropped was total silence. Could hear a pin drop. Processed
I thought it was great.

One criticism is the score playing throughout the entire movie. There were two scenes without score that I noticed, one being the trinity test. I guess it gave it more impact.

And a nitpick - hollywood stuff like "who were the holdouts? Some young senator from Massachusetts...kennedy? John f kennedy." This is in 1959, right? Kennedy would be running for president the next year lol. He was a star by then. Kinda felt like cutesy forrest gump way to shoehorn in a reference that kennedy voted to deny strauss. I admit i rolled my eyes. 

I still loved the movie despite goofy little nitpick. Processed
A bit too long. The Strauss plot wasn't really interesting. The Trinity scene was great, just wish the explosion itself look bigger. The score throughout the whole movie was a tad too much Processed
After sitting with it, I agree its LONG and slow at times but I think that’s okay since it wasn’t a painful watch.

I do think its a great film, a great cautionary tale of science, arrogance and a critique of how cruel governments are. 

My big criticism against the movie is how poor the female characters are.  Which sadly is the Nolan mo with underwritten female characters. Glad to see Olvia Thrilby again, Florence kind of came off a bitch and Emily Blunt’s character felt like an entire missing arc.  She is introduced as a crazy drunk (when its postpartum) and then the film kind of doesn’t develop her or why stayed with Oppenheimer with the constant cheating and being absent. Her monologue in the end would have hit harder knowing more about her character and I would have loved to see more scenes of her and her performance. Processed
I just watched it again, brilliant stuff. Even the imaginary sex scene which was a bit jarring on first watch works. It's also funny how much of a total dick Oppenheimer is to Hill (Rami Maleks character) both times he meets him as a switch and bait for when Hill to come to his defense. Processed
The dichotomy of reviews in here: either this is the best film of the decade or a poorly executed biopic, lol. Processed
Oppenheimer's speech scene after they dropped the atomic bomb. It parallels his quote "**a few people laughed, few people cried, most were silent**"

We see the crowd laughting, crying, all in the middle of the shock and silence in his mind, besides the nice horror vibes and Cillian's great performance there, this scene is a masterpiece. Processed
I’m nearly certain I will enjoy this movie so much more when I can watch it at home with subtitles on. 

The beginning felt very disorienting—which was maybe the point? My takeaway is there’s lots of good stuff but it’s difficult to digest in a theatre setting. Processed
Finally got to seeing this before it ended its theatrical run! Holy capola, 20k comments!

Completely different film from what I was expecting-not necessarily in any negative way.

Primarily right off the bat, the pacing seems peculiarly fast. Particularly with his love interests, their exchanges come off as these quick back-and-forth quips like it's a dress rehearsal or something. But I was able to get on board with the overall cadence, expecting it to be an intentional build up to the climax.

On that point, you go into this movie expecting to be wowed by the sight of an atomic bomb, but in the end, you find yourself much more blown away by the sound design than any of the visuals, interestingly enough. The explosion of the trinity test was a bit disappointing, I have to say, but I couldn't help but admire the manipulation of senses and making us "disappointed" with the visuals of it playing out muted to follow up and shock us with the sudden return blast of sound-of course emulating the real life experience of being in the presence of the explosion. There were a handful of moments other than that that they used a sudden jolt of volume so strikingly it could damn near be considered a jump scare. The intercuts to the visualizations of the science behind the bomb were also just as effective with the sfx in terms of establishing the eerie, cosmic, anxiety-filled atmosphere. Lastly, the score and sound design contributed such a great deal to making a 3 hour feature consisting mostly of dialogue not have a single dull moment.

It's not a perfect film by any means, with its flaws honestly ranging from amusing to laughable to comparable to the most mainstream generic popcorn flicks. The fetishization of Oppenheimer learning Sanskrit and Jean Tatlock randomly happening to point out the "I am become death" part of the book for him to read aloud was pretty ridiculous; the camerawork with Jean fucking him in that small room where the hearing took place when Kitty was forced to hear his confession was way more gratuitous than artful; Robert Downey Jr's character being revealed as the evil mastermind behind things in the third act was rather melodramatic; Nolan has never really been known for his women/wife characters, and while she's probably his most unique so far, Kitty felt like such a bizarre, alcoholic, plot device presence (except for maybe her highlight scene being interrogated in the hearing); etc. Japan has a whole subgenre of atomic bomb literature, a bit of which I've read, so I guess was pretty nitpicky about the "effects of the bomb" depictions they did. The molten skin on the girl kind of just seemed like simple tape make-up/the peeling of very superficial layers, and the charred corpse he stepped on had a long crack on it like a vase when I feel like something to that degree would just disintegrate; I don't know, felt like it could've been more viscerally grotesque to show the true nature of its effects.

The ensemble cast has been talked about for so long before the movie even came out that I was surprised to both see who actually had important roles beyond a couple of lines and who I ended up liking a lot. Was not expecting Matt Damon to be depicted as Oppenheimer's biggest bro-perhaps other than Izzy (and ol' Albert, lol)-kind of doubt it was that way in real life though since he was spending every day with his fellow scientists and only meeting with Groves every so often. We jokingly referred to Lawrence as the Captain America of the scientist Avengers since he was such an All-American chap, lol. Didn't really buy Casey Affleck as a cutthroat colonel or Russian. Dane DeHaan played an annoying little shit well. Even now, reading the Wikipedia article, I'm surprised to find out about the actors I didn't recognize. That was my girl Olivia Thirlby from Dredd in her first movie role in 4 years?!

The editing alongside the sound design is another unexpected element that carries this film and definitely something worth marveling upon rewatch. One subtle thing I really liked was whenever a particularly minor/hard to remember character's name was mentioned, they did this just the perfect amount of short cut/flashback to a scene of theirs just so we could catch a glimpse of their visage and hopefully be reminded who they were.

For whatever reason, I assumed Albert Einstein was going to be limited to just one/scene cameo. My friend and I turned him into a running gag joke of being this Hannibal Lecter/godlike being too larger-than-life to be directly involved in mortal affairs that Oppenheimer could only go to for vague worldly advice. The scene where they're outside at night, the car drives out of frame, and Einstein appears out of nowhere like some homeless raccoon had us laughing our asses off.

The last scene involving Einstein was killer though. Wrapped up the entire film just short of masterfully. I actually had been spoiled about that line of dialogue "Is it possible they didn't talk about you at all? Is it possible they talked about something more important?" beforehand, but it still hit hard.

\~8.9/10 for me upon first watch understanding like 75% of the dialogue without subtitles, lol. Processed
Watched the movie last afternoon. I kinda had to let everything sink in. This movie is definitely gonna stay with me for a long time.

Apart from the fact that every performance is really good, the writing is just so tight. Also the fact that it's 3 hours, non stop, tons of dialogue and somehow it didn't lose me for even a minute. It was so fascinating. All aspects. The science part of it, Oppenheimer's personal life, the questioning of Oppenheimer/Strauss, the horror of the bomb. Legit I got shivers sent down my spine multiple times.

When everything came together with the final scene with Oppenheimer's and Einstein at the pond, the music getting louder, I legit teared up. I never quite experienced anything like it. It's without a doubt the best movie I've seen in years, maybe ever. 

I didn't think the movie would affect me this strongly.

Performance wise I think most would agree that Murphy, Blunt and RDJ are the MVPs, but those that also stood out to me where Benny Safdie, Alden Ehrenreich (especial his last line) Rami Malek and the actor who played Einstein. Processed
Woah 20k comments. I will just say that this movie is significantly better upon second watch. Went from a 7.5 to 9.5 for me. Processed
best shot for me was Oppenheimer being lifted up in front of the American flag after the successful trinity test and everyone applauding him. Only for the next hour of the film to be spent shaming him and outing him as a threat to his own country. Processed
I just find it infuriating that Christopher Nolan makes it so incredibly obvious that the movie is about oppenheimers personal feelings and guilt about making the atomic bomb and explicitly makes it clear he is NOT the hero despite being the main protagonist, and yet twitter goes 

“This movie has zero Japanese or indigenous people and is about the man who made the atomic bomb so it’s glorifying violence and pro atomic bombing.”

Like how braindead do you have to be to get that take from it?! Processed
I feel like the whole movie got summed up really well when Blunt’s character tells Oppenheimer “You can’t commit sins and then have the rest of us feel bad for you when there are consequences.” I’m paraphrasing, but I think a lot of people wanted a more spoon-fed interpretation of his moral conundrum when that’s it. Nolan did a great job of depicting Oppenheimer as someone who did dubious things for what he thought were the right reasons, but was tortured by the fact his ends may not have justified his means. Processed
Controversial opinion: there is no reason to go out of your way to see this in IMAX. 

I'm certain the few scenes like the trinity test and the "synesthesia" (don't really know what else to call it) from the beginning are way more impressive in IMAX but those are about 5 minutes in a 3 hour movie.  

Non-controversial opinion: this is the most invested I've been in a dialogue-focused film since Margin Call.  Nolan did an amazing job at creating suspense, action, and horror through just a bunch of people talking.  

I will absolutely be going to see this again before it leaves theaters. Processed
I would say read a bit about the man's life before you watch the film, really helps out since it such a  dialogue heavy movie. Processed
I don't understand the complaints here about the film focusing so much on Strauss's petty grudge against Oppenheimer. Not only is Oppenheimer's political downfall an important part of his story, and it really highlights the underlying dread of the situation  -- that these are men who hold control over these weapons. They can be petty, vindictive and flawed like Strauss and yet they still hold the power to end the world. The technology is frightening by itself, but putting into the hands of fallible men is where the true horror lies. Processed
Not enough people are talking about Josh Hartnett. I thought he was fucking incredible in this film. Processed
Dr. Mann lived quite a life Processed
Masterful sound design.

And I love that the most tense moments have nothing to do with the bomb Processed
So yeah, the Academy goes to Cillian Murphy... Processed
After watching this film a second time, I loved the courtroom hearings in the last half of the movie even more.

Nolan's signature crosscuts as the tension ramps up during the hearings is just amazing. And the final scene with Einstein and Oppenheimer still hits like a truck Processed
I can’t believe Nolan gave Josh peck the role of pushing the button that changed the world. I was so happy to see him Processed
24 hours later and the ending still stays with you. Super poignant. Been thinking about it all day. Processed
In the suicide snippets, apparently there were gloved hands in the scene dunking Jean Tatlock’s head.

Anyone see this? That's incredibly creepy and reminds me of the ghost scene in Tár. Processed
The Richard Feynman's bit on him using the car glass to block UV light from the nuke instead of wearing dark glasses came from his book [Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041)! Glad to see it featured in the movie! Processed
As soon as I heard Einstein’s voice, I immediately recognized it and knew it was the same actor who helped Bruce recover in the pit during TDKR Processed
Time between detonation and the sound hitting: 100 seconds. (Just because some people were talking about the sound delay in here yesterday, I timed it on my second watch) Processed
The way they showed Jean’s death was amazing. Offering the ambiguous reality of suicide or “suicide” so subtilely made it so much more troublesome/tragic Processed
Didn’t expect the amount of naked Florence Pugh that’s featured in this movie. A surprise, but a welcome one. Processed
The reference to John F. Kennedy reminds me of the post-credits scene in The King's Man where they introduce Hitler like he's the villain of the next Avengers movie. Processed
I loved how they built up the delays for each “boom” for each bomb they tested, ultimately leading up to the big one later on. I was anticipating it, but it still scared the crap out of me lol Processed
First two hours flew by. Last hour? Bit of a slog. Partly because the stakes weren't particularly clear. Why exactly was Strauss out to get Oppenheimer? What were the stakes of the "This is not a trial"? Was it just because Einstein blanked Strauss one time? It just felt very teenage girls having a spat, that didn't fit in with this "Great minds changing/destroying the world". Processed
After watching this, I realize just how long its been since I've seen a piece of cinema carried by its acting, story, and storyboarding/cinematography so much instead of a product that's simply on a much larger screen. I was on the edge of my seat during simple conversations and felt emotional thrills just seeing some characters come into a frame or from seeing facial expressions change (shoutout Alden Ehrenreich). There was this level of tension I felt from the very beginning that waxed and waned but never actually left until I was walking out the door.

The movie was truly ***fascinating***, in so many different kinds of ways. Processed
Loved how simple but important is Rami Malek’s roll in this film Processed
Ehrenreich was a low key standout, going toe to toe with RDJ. Processed
By far the loudest movie I've ever seen. Processed
I had no idea that was Gary Oldman. He loves hiding in plain sight. 

Classic Gary. Processed
When they name drop Kennedy and Strauss gives the little smirk my mind just jumped to STRAUSS KILLED KENNEDY Processed
Trinity test countdown had me scared like a bitch ngl.
Big props to papa Nolan Processed
The way it was edited makes me think the original cut was five hours long and they cut and cut and cut Processed
Murphy and Matt Damon have such an understated yet spellbinding chemistry in this. 

Just absolutely enthralled every-time they appear in a scene with one another, I love the nod between them in that back room hearing. Processed
Maybe I'm just stupid but the non linear storytelling was a bit much here. Like 3 timelines of keeping track with soo many characters made it very convoluting. And the court hearing in the end dragged a bit too long. 

Also the scene Oppenheimer humiliated RDJ wasn't very clear or did i miss something? I felt like I kept up with the plot to that point but suddenly he was deeply humiliated by that statement and plotted revenge like what? Processed
I didn’t realise in the moments leading to Trinity’s detonation that I was holding my breath and squeezing the arms of my chair. That was until my Apple Watch gave me a high heart rate alert. What an incredible sequence, and a hilariously unique experience for me. This movie was a masterpiece. Processed
The scene where Oppenheimer is giving the triumphant speech after the bombing seems like it intentionally imitates Hitler’s speeches, with the ecstatic and bloodthirsty crowd. Especially when he says “I wish we could have used it on Germany” Processed
The most distracting part of this movie is how eerily similar Matt Damon with a mustache looks to my dad Processed
Surprised seeing the top comments praising all actors but rarely mention Cillian Murphy who i think carried the movie...

Do you think he deserves Oscar nomination or no? Processed
I love how the US government is so paranoid about Oppenheimer being a communist when they have Viktor fucking Reznov as their president. Processed
Anyone notice the hand holding down Jean Tatlock's head in the bathtub? It only appears for a split second and is never mentioned or shown again. Thinking it might be the manifestation of Oppenheimer's guilt, as he clearly felt responsible for her death? Processed
gave me a fat existential crisis 10/10 Processed

* Feynman [choosing a dorm room opposite the girls' dormitory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w&t=1075s)? Er, probably for the best that they didn't include that one. Processed
One thing that really amazed me was the intensity of the score as the detonation grew more and more imminent, followed by the use of silence. We’re just left to see this culmination of his work, resulting horror, moral implications, and an agonizing wait for the sound to return. Just brilliant execution there Processed
Watched it for the second time and got to analyze more scenes pickup more things. Gotta say, the explosion was pretty underwhelming to look at visually. The sound design and the music delivered but not the explosion. It was cheated to look larger than it was and also had a short zoomed in clip of the actual trinity test but it just looked way to small for my liking. Watch the actual trinity test footage for reference. Otherwise the movie is still 5/5 for me. Processed
Saw it in IMAX today.  This is probably the most dialogue-dense film I've ever seen/heard.    
There was nary a quiet spot aside from the Trinity test itself, it was 100mph the entire film.   
Absolutely need to watch a second time. Processed
Wtf Gary Oldman was Truman? Processed
one thing i haven't seen anyone mention is how much i loved the framing of his annihilation visions through the pilot in the bomber and the view of the V2 flying past Processed
Scattershot first hour, compelling second hour and a third hour that felt like a completely different film. Processed
Oppenheimer definitely lived up to the hype for me. Still feels weird seeing Josh Peck in this kinda movie though. Hard not to see him as the dorky brother from Drake and Josh Processed
I loved old school practical effects in the movie. Not in pretentious "I hate CGI" way. But because they felt different. I could tell that Oppies visions were some glitter particles filmed close up. Or that burning Earth was unrealistic and barely adding together. But it created the unique retro vibe combined with unusual surrealism. They were also very modest, minimalist. Processed
The gym/speech scene was so flawlessly executed. I can give some personal insight to this as well and why this scene was portrayed the way it is. A few months ago, I took a little too much shrooms and ended up going through drug induced psychosis (which involves high levels of anxiety, paranoia and hallucinations). When the background started to shake behind him, I knew what was about to happen because that’s how it felt to me. Damn near had a panic attack in the theater because it took me back to that horrible experience and made me relive those memories. This scene was incredibly accurate and portrayed perfectly what extreme paranoia and schizophrenia/hallucinations are like.

Everything from the confused feeling, to hearing sounds (like the screaming), misinterpreting faces and other people’s emotions (like the woman crying), or straight up hallucinating visuals (like the couple making out or the guy throwing up, which is basically how you feel on the inside but projected outward by your brain into the environment) was horrifically accurate. Props to Nolan for conveying this feeling/experience so well—not sure how he did it unless he went on a trip himself lol

Apologies if this doesn’t make much sense, I tried to put my thoughts into words as best as I could. I wish I could use the excuse that I’m not a native English speaker but I am, haha. Can’t wait for Nolan’s next project :) Processed
Finally saw Oppenheimer today, and really enjoyed it. I noticed some symbolism which I haven't seen mentioned in any other online forums and I'm curious what you all think of this theory:

Are the horses in the movie, (especially the white horse) a metaphor for death?

When Oppenheimer rides to Los Alamos desert with Lawrence and his brother (before the Manhattan project), they bring four horses. Each of the three people ride dark horses, and Openheimer also leads a white riderless horse along after them. Shortly after, there is a nighttime scene in which camera is framed so that the white horse appears as a blurry spectre immediately behind Oppenheimer, almost like his own shadow or spirit. 

The four horses of the apocalypse is a classic Biblical symbol, especially when there are three dark horses and one white horse (i.e. the pale horse of death). It doesn't seem like this could be a coincidence, since the plot gives no reason why the three riders would go through the trouble of bringing a fourth riderless horse way out into the desert with them.  The only reason to include the riderless fourth white horse is for the symbolism of Openheimer leading Death to this site.

Horses are also associated with death in other scenes like when Oppenheimer dreams he is feeding his horse an apple causing him to suddenly wake up to >!take back the poisoned apple he left on his professor's desk. !<

>!Horses are also a part of the scene where he goes out in the wilderness alone after learning about Jean's suicide. The camera shows us the horses first, before we see him sleeping behind a boulder.!<

I'm sure there are also scenes with horses that aren't associated with death, like when he has a romantic ride with Kitty shortly after they first met. But the overall metaphor seems strong and clear to me despite those exceptions. If I watch it again, I'll have to pay more attention to the color of the horse in each seen to see if it was consistently the white horse associated with death, and also if there are any scenes in which someone rides the white horse or if it's always riderless and being led around by Openheimer. Processed
Finally saw it yesterday. While it was a great docudrama I think I overhyped it in my mind. Maybe it was the lack of epic sceneries  and scores that I hoped to experience. Still, I read all about him and some of the other characters in Wikipedia because it was all very intriguing. Interstellar is still my top favorite Nolan film though. Processed
I had no issues understanding dialogue, but I did see on an IMAX screen ($4 yesterday!).

Definitely didn't recognize Gary Oldman as Truman. Processed
Loved it. 

Strictly talking about secondary characters, I was mostly impressed with somone not mentioned that much in this movie's discourse, that being Casey Affleck as Boris Pash. He was TERRIFYING. Only had two scenes, but with how Nolan cut Groves talking about him and the actual meeting with him, I had shivers down my entire spine.

Jason Clarke as Roger Robb was incredibly electric. He was infuriating, portraying the perfect sleazy public prosecutor, and he brought in some of that nuclear energy they used for Fat Man and Little Boy.

Benny Safdie was fantastic as well. He's never been sweatier, but he was incredible. Edward Teller was definitely the standout in that whole pack of scientists.

I found it interesting how they didn't bother to make Josh Hartnett's Lawrence any older than just a bit of grey on his perfect hair. You had there horribly old Oppie, Kitty, Frank, Rabi, and then good ole Hartnett, made me chuckle. 

Josh Peck and Devon Bostik I felt were really underutilized. I can understand why, and maybe they simply had no big role in the true story, but them two were particularly hyped actors for this film, and did little to nothing. I was surprised to see that the two that flew under the radar in terms of casting but that delivered one hell of a performance were Alden Ehrenreich and Dane DeHaan.

On a sidenote, I don't understand how nobody recognized Gary Oldman as Truman, he looked way more like Oldman than he did in Darkest Hour, for example. Just a bit fatter, with whiter hair, but that face was pretty much Oldman. 

All this said, the true star of the film is the combination of Nolan's directing, Van Hoytema's cinematography and Göransson's original score. Each one of these elements elevated the other and vice versa, making for one of the most immersive and impressive cinematic experiences in my memory. Processed
Just watched it in IMAX and thought the movie was briliant. The cast was fantastic and everyone played their role in an amazing fashion. 


The only criticism I have about the movie is the pacing of the first half / two-thirds of the movie (up to the interrogations becoming more the focal point). The editing was too fast in my opinion. It felt like I was watching a stretched-out movie trailer with a big amount of very short snippets of multiple conversations being thrown at the viewer. They could've reduced the tempo a little bit on that regard, but I did feel like they rectified that in the later parts of the movie. Processed
Best movie of the year, hands down. Saw it 4 times, 2 times in 70mm IMAX. I can only hope it returns to theaters one day so I can experience again in the future. Processed
I'm seeing it a 3rd time today in 15/70 IMAX before my AMC ends its 70mm IMAX run of the film

Masterpiece of a film. Christopher Nolan is a genius auteur Processed
The Trinity test explosion feels like it goes on forever and just when you think it's over—**BOOM!** Processed

The last 20-30 minutes felt so intense. It was like everyone was acting out of the screen lol. Processed
It's been so long since I've seen Josh Hartnett I was thinking to myself the whole time "who is that absurdly handsome man??" Processed
Reading these comments made me realize how lucky I am to have watched it with subtitles. Processed
Good movie. Had great pace, not easy to do for a literal 3 hour film. But, even though the movie was, in parts, tense, and had good pacing - I never felt a sense of emergency, pressure. The race against the Nazi's never felt like a looming threat in the film. It was stated, but never pressured onto the story imo, and therefore lacked additional thrill - which I was expecting. The courtroom drama was pretty mundane in comparison to the trinity test. Blew a lot of steam going in to the 3rd act, and it's kind of hard to top a nuclear explosion.  


Good music and a much better sound mix for the subject matter (as mentioned by others). Processed
I just want to say that I was so mesmerized by Cillian Murphy. This is my first time ever watching anything with him and he was so incredible. He played this role seamlessly Processed
Excellent film.

Great acting throughout despite the long screen-time.

Also appreciated the inclusion of small details like having Feynman declining the safety goggles and the Einstein and Gödel walks. Processed
Going into the movie I knew Americans hated communism but after the movie ended I think the hate was a lot more than I ever imagined. Anyone here who lived during the cold war what was it like living with two different ideology? And what was the root cause of McCarthyism apart from the obvious Soviet fear? Processed
Just reading about the Hiroshima bombing on Wikipedia and saw that it happened on August 6. Huh…lemme check….yup that’s today. Funny coincidence that this was the day I saw the movie Processed

I was looking down at Barbie movie and looking forward to Oppie movie like some sort of opposites. They ended up being very similar. Both had lots of potential, kick ass visuals, greatest cast, but fell flat with the actual storytelling and emotional involvement. It just wasn’t good storytelling that makes you want to go back to the characters and the story and relive it all again be it comedy or drama. Processed
During the trinity test, it took 1 minute 40 seconds for the Shockwave to hit people.  In the movie,  it takes 1 minute 40 seconds for the Shockwave to hit people. Processed
Oppenheimer is even better on a 2nd watch. I went in with a better grasp and understanding of the story this time, so I didn't feel overwhelmed with the amount of information Nolan feeds you. The narrative thread was clearer to me which made the whole film even more emotionally impactful. Especially that crucial scene between Oppenheimer and Einstein at the lake, tying up the black and white version at the beginning with the color one at the end, worked in a tragically epic fashion. One of the best film endings I've ever seen.


It's so impressive to me that Nolan managed to make an 180min film, that is filled to the brim with dialogue and exposition scenes, feel like a 90 min action film. The pacing and the editing were off the charts imo. I never felt the full runtime of this film. It reminded me of Zodiac and JFK, two of my favorite films when it comes to pacing, storytelling and editing. Processed
A lot of interesting comments in this thread. It always genuinely amazes me how people walk away from the same movie I saw with such differing perspectives. 

I thought it was a cinematic masterpiece. Processed
[deleted] Processed
Many people saying RDJ acting stole the show because his character was more dramatic but i think Cillian Murphy immersed the role so hard you can no longer see him acting he just fully embodied Oppenheimer as a character and carried the movie with subtleness. We've seen 3 phases of Oppie's age in the movie (young/prime/old) he changed his way to stand, walk and his voice changes with Oppenheimer's age.

[Cillian's performance](https://youtu.be/BRyUdWr7u-4) in Peacock movie was another overlooked gem if anyone interested to see more of Cillian's method where he dives into the character. Processed

Would recommend everyone to watch that 30min Veritaseum doc on Oppenheimer first, since it gives a lot of context and it makes it so much better to decipher who is who and what happens in which timeline.

Never seen a german crowd applaud after a movie aswell, which means it did really, really well. One of the best cinema experiences ever. Processed
As I was watching Oppenheimer try to argue for his security clearance, all I could think was "Why is he doing this to himself?" even as someone who read *American Prometheus*. 

Then, as the film went on, all I could think was "This man is trying, in some way, to atone for what he did and what he birthed. He's letting his name be dragged through the mud because he feels he deserves it". 

Then Kitty delivers that line...

Seeing Rami Malek tear apart Strauss in the hearing was so satisfying to watch. Him trying to look calm and composed as his life's ambition is left in bloody tatters in front of his face was incredible. Equally, him thinking that Oppenheimer wanted it all to be about him, only to see that it's actually him thinking it's all about him was great too.

Honestly, to me, this is Nolan's best film. It's a spectacle without being a spectacle. Not seen enough love for Ludwig Göransson's score either, which made me feel like I was watching an opera, which suited it perfectly.

Will be very surprised if Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jnr. aren't at least nominated for the Academy Award. I think DiCaprio and DeNiro will both give them a run for their money after *Killers of the Flower Moon*, but they have a very good chance of winning here. 

Would love to see Nolan win for Best Director too, but I fear Scorsese may just have this one. Processed

Emily Blunt was sensational. For real. That break from acting really did her well because she turned it out. and I'm not just talking about the interview scene. In general throughout, she gave a really compelling performance with fairly limited screentime. Processed
I love the film overall but my biggest complaint is the non-linear storytelling. 


I felt like it took away from the urgency and drive to get the bomb completed when the film keeps cutting to after the success of it in the trial scenes. Given that the big drawing scene of the film is the trinity test, I would have liked the entire film up to that point to revolve around it. And I would have liked a scene or two to show the pressure of the Nazis or Japanese enemies to further drive it home cuz this is WW2 dammit. The constant timejumps also made it hard for me to keep track of the many,many characters in this film. 


Other than that, a really good movie. Just wished it was a lil easier lol. Processed

Saw it today in 70mm IMAX at Irvine Spectrum. Other than what looks like specks of dust throughout the film and the entire screen turning black for about a second around the point after the sex scene, where Murphy and Pugh are talking, the movie went well. I don't know if 70mm IMAX is necessary for a film like this, but damn, does it pull it off well. When Nolan said he purposely filmed this in 70mm, I believe it. The sound mixing is incredible. Some bone-shaking moments especially the first 30 minutes and towards the end. The shots where the entire screen fills up look amazing. Sort of in awe whenever it happens. 

I'm a sucker for sound/audio and watching this in this format confirmed for me that sound is the most important quality in making a film. My only complaint about it is that the dialogue was tough to hear throughout the film. Background music being played for like 90% of the film is an interesting choice although I guess that's Nolan's thing.

As for the film, at least for me, it feels like it requires multiple viewings. 99% dialogue. Tons of characters. I lost focus a few times during the first 1.5 hours, but the third act picks up. That ending though with the soundtrack accompanying it. Sheesh. Processed
Great great film. Incredible experience. Processed
While I'm sure many here might have found out, the decision to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance was [vacated late last year](https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-statement-doe-order-vacating-1954-atomic-energy-commission-decision). Processed
I have to see it again.

I’m sure the movie was fantastic but it was one of the worst theater experiences in years for me. 

I finally get to see it in IMAX and three people on my right were talking full volume, laughing and joking for the final 45 minutes. They kept dropping their stuff and laughing at it and would stand up way too much. They took a photo with the flash on and used their phones flashlights to look for random things they dropped on the ground. One played a random YouTube video? Then someone else’s ringer went off at a pivotal moment.

 I got nothing from the last 3rd of the movie because of them. Plus my friend chose seats in the far back for some reason. I wish I had the balls to confront the people but I have no backbone. I’m surprised no one in the audience did anything. Processed

Going to go against the flow I'm seeing here and say I thought the opening had more issues than the ending. The first cut to RDJ was so jarring it felt we were watching a DVD and someone hit the "Next scene" button on accident.

First 15-20 mins I was questioning if I was going to even like the film at all. Then enjoyed the rest. Far from Nolan's best work though. Processed
There is a scene where Oppenheimer gives a lecture in the Netherlands, but he speaks German instead of Dutch, and afterwards it’s confirmed it should have been Dutch. Anyone noticed this aswell? 

I’m from the Netherlands btw, so i know that it doesn’t sound Dutch at all Processed
This is definitely gonna require a rewatch or two more, but I think this was definitely one of Nolan’s best films in years, and maybe his best work from his filmography yet.


The cast, including supporting actors and even actors that just literally showed up for a scene, were fantastic and firing on all cylinders. I was amazed by the amount of faces I saw that I didn’t know were involved; Casey Affleck (who was terrifying in his brief appearance as a understated, sociopathic intelligence officer), Alex Wolff and certainly not Gary Oldman. All phenomenal.

The two leading standouts though are obviously Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I’ve been waiting for Murphy to have a leading role for awhile now, and this was an absolutely stellar debut.

I did some reading on Oppenheimer while in high school, and Murphy managed to convey quite a bit of who Oppenheimer was; from the brilliance, to the ideological & political indecisiveness, to the womanizing etc.

Robert Downey Jr. was great as Lewis Strauss, and I’ll have to think about it for awhile, but maybe one of my favorite performances from him. Incredibly cunning and sinister, but also weirdly petty and paranoid.

This movie had an incredible, building sense of dread, but I think my favorite scene from the movie was when Oppenheimer was given the speech in the little, church like building, and the celebration progressively got more crazed and animalistic, and then the lone scream broke out. The whole sequence had a very uncanny, eerie atmosphere. Think this was great both as just a genuinely unsettling horror scene, and an insight into America’s gross indifference at the bombing.

The only one downside/critique I have would be the trinity test bombing. I know Nolan is fanatic of practical effects and filming everything in camera, but some smartly and minimally used CGI would have made the scene better I think. I’ve viewed some nuclear bomb footage, and unfortunately, at least for the time being, there’s no way to accurately depict it using only practical effects.

Overall, truly enjoyed this, more so than a lot of Nolan’s recent stuff. The runtime breezed by for me, cast was great and the score was amazing. Processed
This movie made me immediately buy the biography it was based on (American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin), where I found that both Kitty and Teller’s testimonies at the “hearings” were essentially verbatim from the true story. Processed
Probably made a mistake by watching Barbie before this, but for a 3 hour long movie, the film felt really fast paced. 
I kept getting lost for a second during some time jumps, but I really want to watch it again Processed
I read the book this movie was based on last October before I knew this was being turned into a movie. I can not fucking tell you how happy I was to watch this movie after having read the book. Life can be so incredibly rewarding sometimes, I feel blessed Processed
I like how he subverted my expectations for the Trinity test by keeping it near silent before exploding with sound. 

My favorite parts were when reality was kind of bent with hallucinations of another blast, people sick from radiation, Florence appearing during the questioning, etc.

The only thing that took me out of immersion were the constant cuts in some parts. Like in rapid fire conversation, cuts every time the speaker changes, which was a lot.

Also, there were so many great actors in small roles that I recognized from various places, but it didn’t distract me much. They fit. Processed
Fantastic film but the final act of the interview scenes was 15 minutes too long and it felt agonising after such a fast paced narrative and shooting style. There wasn't enough weight on 'Oppy' losing his security clearance for me to care long enough to be invested in the final act, until the brilliant closing 5 minutes. Processed
the gym speech scene... wow. louder and more painful than the trinity test. 

had my doubts going in but this was a great movie, nolan deserves praise. so many ways that this could've gone way wrong. Processed
I will admit I only watched because my dad wanted to go see it and because of the Barbie/Oppenheimer memes, but I still enjoyed it. I didn’t really understand what was going on most the time because of the science speak but what I could catch was really enticing. Even if I didn’t catch everything I was still on the edge of my seat. 

To me, the score was the real star of the show. Just marvelous. I’m glad we saw it in IMAX, too. My first experience with it and I was blown away. Processed

felt the movie had a meta commentary from the Struss line - Oppenheimer wants it to be about the Trinity Test and not Hiroshima/Nagasaki.   
The movie is totally about the Trinity Test/ Clearance hearing/ Confirmation hearing down plays the A-bomb drops on Hiroshima/ Nagasaki. Brutal episode of history. Processed
One of the best films of the year, probably will be top 3 of the year for me.

- Cillian Murphy gives an absolutely amazing performance. Easily the frontrunner for Best Actor right now.
- Florence Pugh was in like 6 scenes but was the standout. Making her death ambiguous, suicide or murder, with quick cuts was a great editing choice.
- Direction, Score and Cinematography are 10/10.
	- The trinity scene is heart palpitating and expertly direct by Christopher Nolan.
	- Ludwig Goransson using strings and classical music is phenomenal
	- Hoyte Van Hoytema with trinity scene and speech with the stomping was perfect 
- Writing wise, this is Nolan's best work. The non-linear structure with black and white scenes is a interesting narrative choice. 
- The set-ups in first 2 acts to deliver the twists in the 3rd act was honestly mind-blowing. I see why the script was likened to The Social Network.
- Supporting actors (David Krumholtz, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Olivia Thirbly, Alden Herenreich etc.) all had their moments. Jack Quaid with the tiny drums was a fan favorite!
- RDJ and Emily Blunt killed it in the 3rd act! 

Cinematically, Oppenheimer will be remembered as best films of the decade. Will deservedly dominate in award shows next year Processed
It was a pleasant surprise to see Josh Hartnett on the big screen again. Processed
My favorite scene might be one of the pre trinity tests.

The guy with the detonator says “heads down everyone” before sticking his head up to watch the explosion. Then when it’s over in under a second and General Groves quips “We’ll I hoped we learned something” and the one scientist says “we learned that we need to be a lot farther away” I laughed so hard.

What an absolutely brilliantly written film. Then beyond that, it was expertly acted, beautifully shot, and with the most haunting use of music I've heard in a long time throughout the entire thing. I'm not even that into historical films or biopics, but this is a masterpiece. Processed
Anyone else feel like they could've done a better job of showing the scale of the trinity test detonation? I know there's some optical illusion camera work being done for a smaller sized explosion since Nolan refuses to use CGI, but he could have done slightly more to show just how tall the explosion was. Like maybe some more prolonged shots of the environment around the bomb site. Kinda like what he did with many scenes of Interstellar. I couldn't grasp the size and was kinda disappointed since it's literally the point of the movie, unless I missed something. Processed
I really enjoyed the movie. The only thing I wanted to see more of was the actual science. The movie was about his life for the most part and the politics of the bomb but I feel very little was focused on the bomb itself. It barely explained why a hydrogen bomb was a much bigger deal than the atomic bomb having focused on it so much. It didn’t explain the differences between the Trinity bomb, fat man and little boy or even explain how many bombs they could make until they shipped the two actually used out of the facility. 

For having such focus on the setting up of the Los Alamos lab and the recruitment of the scientists it never explained what they were working on or figuring out. Why did it take 3 years and 2 billion dollars? Were they just waiting to have enough plutonium for 3 years? The only thing the movie showed as far as I can remember was them testing different ignition devices. Maybe it really wasn’t that exciting in reality. I don’t know. But I was expecting this movie to help me learn more about it.

I spent time last week researching how the bomb actually works at a high surface level and thank god I did or I would of been even more lost as I don’t think I learned anything new in that regard. Processed
The scene where Oppe is in the auditorium and the Americans are pounding in the stands and shaking the room with their applause while he wrestles with the weight of the chain reaction that has now entered the world had me absolutely shaken. All the while the crowd doesn't even understand the full gravity of the situation, it was just about the nazis. 

Chef's kiss Processed
Biopic is my least favorite genre, and I didn't like Nolan's last few films like at all. So I was seriously considering passing on this film, but my thought was changed after finally watching it in the theater. I liked it much more than I expected. It might be my new favortie film of Nolan.

I really liked Nolan's approach here. He made the biopic almost like a political thriller. I think it was the right choice to choose a story structure where the past and present intersect constantly. It was a bit jarring until I got used to it, but once it clicked, I was immediately immersed in the movie. If the story had progressed chronologically, the hearing scenes might have been very anticlimactic.

Thematically, I loved Oppenheimer's internal conflict about the nuclear bomb. He was proud of what he and coworkers had achieved, but he felt deeply guilty about what the nuclear bomb brought to the human races. It was out of his hands once it was made, but he couldn't be free from responsibility since he contributed to its creation. I found the irony of the fact that an invention that could bring about the end of humanity to be the only solution to end a terrible war very interesting. It's a weapon of mass destruction for sure, but if he hadn't built the nuclear bomb, someone else surely had done. I'm not saying he didn't have a choice, but who could blame his choice after all? What would you have done if you were in his position? I don't think there was a right or wrong answer here. Processed

Saw it 4 hours ago, 

I am distinctly underwhelmed by it as a whole. 

Positives: 
i. Very well acted. Everyone in it played their roles exceptionally. 

ii. Some moments of it were genuinely captivating cinema, the Trinity Test being "one of those" all time cinema scenes. 

iii. It was very nice to leave a movie that was loaded with so much dialogue. 

iv. It absolutely does hold your attention 

v. Sets, clothing, locations etc are incredibly on point, fully immersive and at no point are you watching going "this doesn't look right". 

Negatives 
i. This movie is essentially about egos and moral dilemmas, but very little actual weight is given to either. However a lot of time is given to said egos and dilemmas. I really don't think any of it is fleshed out beyond a scene or two at the end. 

Honestly, after 3 hours of hating a few people, the pay off of seeing a man's ego shattered is not worth the 3 hours it took to have it done in in 3 minutes of scenes. 

ii. This movie wants you to know about the subject matter going in, which means it is really rather pleasant to not be spoonfed for once, however, and I appreciate this sounds like I'm impossible to please, if you do know about the subject matter, it's actually a bit enraging. 

He tried to kill someone, was a bit of a shithead, nothing is given to this other than 1 scene and a scene of him cheating on partners. Both of which are just brushed off in a few lines of dialogue. 

The actual Manhattan project beyond his role, the race against time, the reason it's used against Japan, Potsdam conference, the sheer technical accomplishment, the raging anti-semitism hidden as anti-communism of the era, the rise of the military industrial complex, any explanation of why the US/UK/West distrusts the USSR so much, that the bombs did indeed end WW2 without any allies soldier having to fight on the Japanese Mainland, the reason behind the red scare and a host of other things you might know about the era are blasted over in 1 remark or not at all. 

It leaves you feeling like you've either been left wanting  the film to explore those in more depth (not a huge amount, but some) or if you had no idea of the subject matter, I imagine a bit clueless about why he is being removed from his role of influence beyond he knew some university-student level communists who still developed the bomb when asked. 

iii. Character Arcs. The lack thereof. 
Honestly, only Matt Damon's Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr is allowed to have anything approaching character development. Everyone else seemingly has maybe 1 tweak in what they end up doing, rather than any change in them. I appreciate it's a mostly biographical movie, but it still requires some level of story telling in my opinion and it lacks something important for it. 
Honestly, at the end of it, it's very hard to rationalise that anyone had won their war, they had ended war as it was, yes they now had the ability to end all life, but major powers could not go on as they had which means no more world wars. You just don't care enough about anyone based on development to care about them. Yes it's a historical film which is absolutely up my alley, but it's still a film and needs to entertain and catch you more. 

iv. Pacing, or more so, dedicating too much time at points for very little pay off. 

Again, the issues around his hearing, without any context given just drag on, especially as most seemingly seem to be there, ultimately, to wrap up an Easter egg comment from earlier in the film. They wrap them up neatly and I enjoyed some of the call backs (aka, Oppenheimer is essentially an Einstein - aka the best of his era, but his era rapidly passed - but they take so long, with actors giving it their all to drag weak scenes to be captivating, but ultimately incredibly inessential in the context of things. 

v. If this is supposed to be somewhat of a biopic, or at least the telling of his story, Oppenheimer as a film gives you very little of the man himself. I feel like Nolan intentionally kept him an enigma to let the viewer put themselves in his place, but ultimately I feel the end product isn't the tale of an exceptional person, in the exact right place at the exact right time to book his place in history, rather instead leaves him appearing as an annoyed Project Manager who is unhappy and a bit of a dick. I just think he wanted the audience to make up their own mind (commendable) so much that he neglected to give them enough to make their mind up either way. 

vi. The soundtrack - brilliant in big scenes, weak af the rest of the time. It just makes you feel dread, but not a paced one, rather just 3 hours of being on edge whilst it goes on. The silence is used brilliantly, but it's made more impactful by the fact it's the only time in the film I felt like I was not being forced to stay engaged by the soundtrack, rather than what was on the screen. 

vii. Being a history bore, things were left out, but not wrong. The exception, IMO, is the portrayal of Truman was very harsh. He had arguably the hardest role in the world going on from FDR. Taking the oval office, in a war, from a man who kept the entire Manhattan Project from him, knowing he was playing out both the end of the European arena, needing to end the Asian arena and to set down a marker to his friend by convenience only in the USSR for the end of the war, knowing the iron curtain was coming, demobilisation of possibly the largest force in history all on an unelected presidency. To give him 1 line about how it was him who has to live with giving the order to kill 120k people, then leaving him as some slack jawed yokel with no compassion for the only other man who also shared a similar level of personal guilt felt like a kick in the jaw. 

In contrast to Oppenheimer's constant approval of FDR and the films little wink to JFK at the end left it feeling very hamfisted around the political side of things. 

God I wrote a lot there. Good, not great, feel it did have the bones of a great film but didn't meet it, which was a shame. Very low down the rewatchable scale for me as well. Processed
I loved this movie. I won’t reiterate the thousands of reasons others have here, it’s all the same stuff. 

I do have one problem that’s a personal thing and wasn’t enough to take away from the overall spectacle of the movie, but was noticeable. 

In Nolan’s interviews he has a very well rehearsed line about why he doesn’t use CGI, describing it as “anodyne” or “a bit safe” or that “it’s difficult to convey threat”

I think unfortunately the trinity test scene seems to suffer from this philosophy a bit, personally I did not find the close up fireball shots to be as impactful to me as even watching the raw, real footage from the test. If there was one place to use CGI in the movie, I think this would have been it. Processed
Am I crazy or in the scene where Jean Tatlock is committing suicide, is there a split second where you see a hand that isn’t hers push her head into the water?? Need to see it again but man I thought I saw that. Processed

Beautifully shot, fantastic performances, and Nolan's direction just might be the best it's ever been. I have some relatively minor issues, but all in all, more than worth a watch, and if you're on the fence or thinking you'll wait for it to hit VOD, just go to your theather - it actually makes a difference.

I've always though Nolan's movies are needlessly convoluted and complicated almost just for the sake of it.  My favorite of his is probably Dunkirk, but even there, it feels like the non-linear narrative kind of unravels at a couple of points. In Oppenheimer, though? Not only does it work, but it works damn near perfectly. Funnily enough, I randomly felt the urge to rewatch The Social Neteork yesterday, and I can't help but feel like this is the same movie, but with nukes instead of Facebook. For a good chunk of its runtime, it's a very dialogue-rich movie that transcends everything Nolan has written before thanks to career-best performances from just about evertone involved.

Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic, and I'm so glad he's coming back to "real" acting. Murphy is a true revelation, and just plain excels in the portrayal of a very complicated, very conflicted figure. You know how people say there's character actors stuck in leading men's bodies? Murphy is the opposite of that, and he should absolutely get more leading roles after this. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are very underused, sadly, but that's just because the script doesn't give them a whole lot to work with. When they *are* on screen, though, they're as good as they've ever been.

And that last point sort of brings me to the only real issue I had with the movie. There's just so much stuff going on all the time. It feels like someone triee to condense Band of Brothers or Chernobyl into three hours. A new character is introduced every five minutes, only to come back again an hour and a half later or at the end of the movie. There's some pacing issues as well, with Nolan introducing a new little diversion on their way to the Bomb, but then that's resolved two minutes later, while the next issue they run into takes them 15 to get through. A lot of the comments I'm seeing here say they had issues with the last act, but it was the opposite for me: there were some parts leading up to Trinity that felt really messy and undercooked, but once the test was done and we got to Oppenheimer's "kangaroo court" and Strauss' confirmstion hearing, I was all in. It was a good twist for those unfamiliar with *that* part of Oppenheimer's life, and the stakes feel higher than they did during the building of an actual atomic bomb. Processed
That ending though. Holy shit. Couldn’t have been wrapped up better. The anticipation to seeing what Oppy and Einstein were talking about, thinking it’s about Strauss, only to find out that it’s the true message of the film.

We are all fucked, and this was inevitable. Processed
The absolute second the bomb dropped someone’s iPhone alarm went off. For a moment I thought Nolan had memed everyone cause everyone in the theatre laughed. Processed
I loved it. Definitely left me feeling unnerved - not just about how the atomic bomb changed our world/trajectory,  but also about how the machine chews people/countries/groups up & spits them out. Processed
So, I saw this movie on IMAX (I assume digital). And I went in blind, only seeing the trailer and was aware on surface who Oppenheimer was and it was the first Nolan film I've seen. But, I really liked the film and 3 hours went by breeze. Sometimes jumping from scene to scene was a bit meh, but otherwise I was really pleased and I liked it. Processed
The part with Truman was awesome Processed
The build up around the middle of the film, from when they're discussing potential targets with the minister of war to the actual trinity test, was some of the most haunting cinema I've ever seen, despite knowing exactly what happens I was on the edge of my seat, palms sweaty with nerves. 

Best film I've seen in a while although I can completely understand why people wanted more Oppenheimer with their viewing of Oppenheimer. Processed
When I first saw it, I thought the third act was great albeit a dramatic drop in intensity. But as I've reflected on the ending, I've realised it's about how the Western state apparatus chews you up and spits you out once you dissent, and that political actors care only for the assertion of their power regardless of consequence. Strauss was obsessed with a graph and what people thought of him, Oppenheimer was obsessed with his own hypocrisy in the adulation of creating a device that could destroy the world. The film actually doesn't work without it Processed
I loved this movie. I understand some people frustrations with it though. 

It requires 110% of your attention. It’s 2 hours and 59 minutes of dialogue. The Nuke scene isn’t really the climax. I get how some people are let down by that. However it’s so much more than that. It’s a massively important story about American/World history and a character study of all the big players involved. 

The way the timelines all interplayed with one another I thought was masterful. Totally get how some view it as chaotic though. It’s not a Linear A to B, but if you keep attentive through the whole thing you will be rewarded when it all clicks. 

It’s a case of “a tremendous movie I can’t really recommend to most people”. I think you really have to be a fan of films and the art to like it, however I wouldn’t tell anyone not to see it because of that. Just understand this isn’t a typical WW2 movie nor is it a typical biopic. It’s done in the artists style. Processed
The fucking balls on Nolan to include a shot of Godzilla rising from the ocean in a post credits scene Processed
I didn't realize Gary Oldman was there. Dude is a chameleon. He just melt into this roles. Processed
I thought it was a great film that really might take a few viewings to properly digest.  Overall I felt it was mostly about how science is hijacked by political agendas rather than about the moral position of Oppenheimer himself.  It shows how he was, really through his empathy (note the exchange with Truman) manipulated by cultural hegemony.  I don't think they mentioned Antonio Gramsci in the dialogue of the film (I wouldn't have the capacity to clock it honestly) but I came away thinking about this quote   
“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”   
― Antonio Gramsci, Antonio Gramsci: Prison Letters Processed
I really like the distinction between Oppenheimer's motivation for 'going through the motions' of being discredited and Strauss' assumptions about his motivation.

Oppenheimer felt he had a reckoning coming, invariably, to the extent that even a kangaroo court repudiation still held some ethical validity. Strauss thought he only cared about being attached to the 'heroic' element of the Manhattan project, the purely anti-Nazi necessity of the Trinity test, and not the utter soullessness of a-bombing thousands of civilians. But 'succeeding' at framing himself heroically to the world/history is the last thing Oppenheimer would want.

Also really enjoyed the inversion of the pacing, where the classroom and political scenes are edited fast as fuck and you barely get a sense of the physical space before the scene's over. It only slows down during momentous conversations (meeting Groves, talking with Einstein, the Trinity test countdown, sex-as-fatalistic-debate, and the most significant testimonies in the farce trial.)

However, the ending didn't quite hit me because I couldn't figure out why Einstein would pretend to be nice/not hate Strauss until that conversation. It seemed like he basically just chilled out and tried to avoid being used as a pawn by politicians after fleeing Germany, so...why would he bother in any case? It was like the movie got so wrapped up in framing the ending with Strauss' self-centered thinking making him make a mistake that it forgot Einstein wouldn't have really cared to put on a nice face before that point, either.

I’m sure it was a combination of very well done makeup and sparing use of cgi possibly, but the aging and deaging was phenomenal. 

Young Cillian Murphy looked absolutely real, 99% of the time even when it’s well done I feel our brain can tell something is off. But with this movie it straight up looks like an actual young Cillian Murphy. 

And RDJ looking old was just perfect. Yeah he’s not a super young guy but the thinning hair and age spots again looked absolutely 100% real. You just could not tell there was any makeup or effects used, but they were. Idk if that’s enough to get best makeup but it’s pretty much the best I’ve ever seen. Especially with how detailed and close up Nolan likes to shoot, it was just crazy good Processed
Awesome movie, watched it on IMAX today.

Only thing I don't get is, the part where Oppenheimer went to Leiden (Netherlands) to give a university talk in Dutch, he actually talked German?! 

I mean, that would have been researched so easily. Kind of a bad mistake if you ask me 😀 Processed
For me after watching the Movie for the first time I was confused by parts of the plot and timeline. I understood the main events that took place but got lost in the smaller moments. I then read the book American Prometheus and went back to watch it a second time. This time I had a clear understanding of the timeline and all of the events that were unfolding which made it an even more fascinating experience. Processed

Petition to have Benny Safdie in every movie. He always crushes it! Processed
Brilliant performance by all honestly. The one thing that threw me into a loop was how Josh Peck had a pretty significant role 😂 I couldn’t unsee it lol.
 
The actor that played Frank Oppenheimer is relatively new so what a career milestone for him. One thing I would’ve really appreciated however was more into Oppenheimer and Tatlock’s relationship. Historically, he was obsessed with her and I am sure she knew more than what Nolan led on. Processed
That second to last shot of Earth being engulfed in flames was chilling. Excellent score to top it off as well. Processed
When it landed on that last lingering shot of Oppenheimer’s face by the pond, I was just sitting there going “please cut now please cut now please cut now” because I felt how good of a fricking ending it would be. And then he shuts his eyes closed in distress and the credits roll! What an ending. It’s so devastating and perfectly encapsulating of humanity’s doom. I loved this film. Processed
It was wild how from one scene to another-- practically every character introduced was portrayed by a familiar face. An actor worthy of being their own main character or leading role but instead a relatively minor if not background part. 

 This has to be one of the deepest casts of all time, yeah? Processed
At first I was wondering why the hell Josh Peck had more lines and screentime than Oscar nominated actor Rami Malek. Then it all came together Processed
The musical score was phenomenal. I downloaded the sound track the moment we drove out of the theater.

Ludwig did a great job, and added immensely to what was shown on the screen. Processed
Didn’t the opening of the movie it say 1.Fission, like it was going to have set chapters; and then those didn’t appear the rest of the movie?

Edit: I guess Fission is the first track in Göransson’s soundtrack so maybe a mistake? Processed
The last few shots of the movie was some sombre ass shit for the times we live in. Processed
I’m all for people doing the Barbenheimer double-watch thing, but when there’s a group of teenagers in your theatre who clearly AREN’T interested in watching a 3-hour historical drama and are instead flicking through Snapchat and Instagram half the time, you start to wonder what was even the point? Processed
Has any other big name actress spent a higher percentage of her screen time naked than Florence Pugh in this movie? Processed
I'm still in awe at the decision to use just a lone scream in the theater scene. I feel like it would have been an easy choice to include a cacophony of screams but just having one makes it so much more poignant somehow. 

Amazing film. Processed
Oppenheimer? More like Rizzenheimer. My dude had serious game with the ladies Processed

It's mad that the reasons >!to drop the bomb, show it to the world and drop the second to show it's not a one time thing!< is actualy insane and crazy but actualy makes sense.... Processed
That was depressing, gotta watch something funny to help my mood.

RDJ could get an Oscar for this film I think Processed
I liked the movie, but I think the intercutting of timelines is a gimmick and a crutch for Nolan. 

E.g. it was unclear what year the Soviets had the bomb test (the giant dinner table meeting w/ Downey's character and all the scientists).

&#x200B;

And in some cases the intercutting breaks some of the tension (other cases it adds) Processed
Not perfect but deeply depressing primarily through its central narrative over the downey jar character who essentially was quite prepared to attempt to destroy Oppenheimer over some minor perceived slight even though he ended up destroying himself in the process and was still going down lashing out at anybody he could. A scientific endeavour handing immense destructive power to mere humans with all there human faults. Processed
Anyone else intrigued by the flip of color and B&W compared to most films? Here, it was surprising to me that Nolan used B&W for the more modern scenes, and color for the older ones. Was this to represent the world post-bomb? Or more practical in not wanting the bomb sequences to be in B&W?

Overall, liked the movie but agree with many commenters it was far from flawless. Also, I loved Benny Safdie in Good Time but found his accent a little cringe here. Processed
Finally saw this film last night and I'd describe it in this one sentence:

How they blew up the man who blew up the world Processed
9/10 for me.

Murphy was unreal as Opponehimer. E Processed
I went in with somewhat middling expectations and was delightfully surprised. It’s a three hour movie that feels like six, but I enjoyed every moment of it. Feels like there’s a sizable amount of negativity around the fact that people think Nolan is putting on airs, but the movie and narrative comes neatly together, and getting flustered over imagery included for effect misses the forest for the trees. I think it was a beautifully told story. If it wasn’t for Nolan at the helm, those same people would be singing its praises. Processed
6pm showing in 70mm film. It’s top tier Nolan. Somehow extremely gripping with pure scenes of dialog which only he can do. If you go in expecting a lot of explosions, be forewarned this is like JFK and other courtroom dramas. Expertly done. 

But it. Is. LONG. At 2.5 hrs checking watch. And it feels it. No clapping at the end of my screening. I think general audiences will struggle with it. 

2 things:

1. If I hear Roger Robb ask another question, I will scream. Maybe that’s the point? 

2. And I want Einstein to pop up randomly in all future movies. 

9/10. Processed

For people going into a three hour biopic about a scientist and the surrounding politics complaining about it being a three hour biopic about scientists and politicians talking, what exactly did you expect? The entirety of the movie to just be atomic bombs going off and gory after images? Processed
Best movie I've watched in a long while. They name dropped John F. Kennedy at the end like a Marvel cameo😭

A Nolan movie about the moon landing would be incredible. Processed
so I wasn’t able to understand what Cillian Murphy was saying when he humiliated RDJ… can someone let me know what the judge asked and what Oppenheimer responded with? Processed
I really enjoyed it and it had me riveted despite being a fairly talky 3 hour movie. Cilian Murphy gave a tremendous performance and I hope he gets an Oscar nom for it. The nearly continuous music score was a wonder to listen to as well. I think it's a movie that I'll only watch once though. Not really much replay value for me.

For whatever reason, I was thinking that Nolan would show us an on the ground perspective from Hiroshima or Nagasaki when the atomic bomb detonated. Processed
I haven’t seen anyone mention this yet, I think the reason Nolan had a character go out of their way to mention JFK was because he cited Oliver Stone’s movie “JFK” as a huge influence on this movie, especially those scenes Processed

Everyone talking about best actors and nobody mentioning Jason Clarke, the man behind Roger Robb. 

Most hated character since Jofferey. 

I wanted to jump across that hearing table and strangle him when he was yelling at Oppenheimer. 

Amazing acting. Processed
All the performances were great. Murphy, Damon, RDJ, Blunt, Pugh, Malek, etc. but I think the one that really stood out to me as surprisingly phenomenal was Jason Clarke. Man you really hate his character but he was so good in that role Processed
Robert Downey Jr. should always be in every Nolan movie moving forward. Processed
Obviously it's a movie about Oppenheimer and not the bombings themselves, but I'm glad they showed glimpses of the effects of the bombs in the gym scene.

Having recently been to both of Japan's bomb site memorials and seeing the very real legacy of nuclear warfare there, the gym scene was especially heavy for me.

Using parallels of people crying for joy and holding each other (while thousands across the world are crying in anguish and holding each other in their last moments) right after the skin melting and charred corpse scene was a masterful work of filmography imo. Processed
I think RDJ did a great job, however, I’d really love to see a cut of the movie that didn’t rely on him as a framing and exposition device. I think you could still find a way to use that character in moderation that would make the film feel less bloated. The last 45-minutes I found myself wondering “…and it’s over, right?” The film doesn’t need an antagonist throughout. The story is compelling enough that it works on the merits of trying to tell a story about the man behind the atom bomb alone. Processed
Anyone else laugh their ass off when Matt Damon delivered the line: this is the most fucking important thing in the fucking world!!! Processed
I can’t remember the last time I was in a packed cinema and the whole audience was so locked in. Especially considering it is basically a 3 hour talkie.   No one, was fidgeting, looking at phones or leaning in to talk to their partners even. Processed
The theatre didn't have subtitles which i kind of need and the audio mixing with music happening a lot of time did not help. Processed
The one thing I was a bit hazy on, in retrospect, was the impetus for Strauss' animosity toward Oppenheimer. 

I *think* the film was suggesting that Strauss initially wanted to "collect" Oppenheimer in his institute as a sort of feather in his own cap, but soured on Oppenheimer when he turned out to be an independent thinker (scientifically and politically.). Coupled with his own insecurity -- his insistence that Oppenheimer turned Einstein against him, and the isotope joke that really stuck with him -- I read it as an egotistical man who wanted Oppenheimer as an achievement but ended up viewing him as an opponent.

...but was it really that petty? And what was the context for the joke that clearly rubbed him so much the wrong way? I wasn't quite sure what the setting for that exchange was; looked like another hearing of sorts? Processed
Did anyone else notice the lump (cyst) on the right hand side of Cillian Murphy's neck? Processed
The sound design was the best part of the movie for me. Absolutely classic Nolan score out of Göransson as well. Some moments brought me almost to tears without anything traditionally dramatic happening. Processed
I've been describing Oppenheimer as a classic, straightforward biopic wearing a Christopher Nolan costume. Some of the most tense and nerve-wracking moments were just Cillian Murphy pouring every ounce of emotion he could into his eyes while the score went bananas, not intense action scenes. I left satisfied that I had seen a solid Christopher Nolan movie and was surprised that I had highly enjoyed and remained engaged with a 3 hour biopic.  I was expecting it to drag a little; it did but still held my attention while it slowed down.

Here's a fun fact from LPOTL: During the Trinity test one of the scientists described the initial flash of light as an all-consuming brightness that overpowered him until he was screaming in his brain for it to stop. He said it felt like eternity--it was 2 seconds. I couldn't help but remember that during the many moments of extreme, unbearable music that went on \*just\* long enough, and would not be shocked to learn that it was a conscious choice to mimic that sensation. Processed
Anyone else immediately recognize Bernard from The Santa Clause movies?! Can’t believe how far he’s come! He’s now been in an Oscar-worthy, cinematic masterpiece..and Oppenheimer. LOL jk, fantastic movie Processed

Can someone please tell me how Rami Maliks' character just knows everything about RDJ and Cillian? 

It was a good scene but I didn't understand how he could have known all these things about RDJ's characters' plans, given that he was just there taking notes in 2 scenes; the one intro scene where Cillian meets him and the other scientist and the second one where they are about to meet the secretary of defense (and it looks like he is advising Cillian against it.) Processed
* Even though it's 3 hours it kept my attention, I didn't feel the need for a break.  

* The acting was great, made me feel like they were the characters.  

* All I knew going into it was that Oppenheimer was the head of the project so a lot of the different plotlines were new to me. Processed
There were a ton of famous people in this thing and ton of great performances here, but seeing "old" Josh Harnett was a real surprise and he was great in this. Processed
Man, leaving out Josh Hartnet in the cast list feels wrong, never been a big fan, but I thought he killed it in this role. Almost unrecognizable. Processed

I just wanted to add that it was nice to see Alden Ehrenreich acting again. He is a talented actor that really did all he could to make Han Solo a thing and I hope to see him in more films again. Processed
That little “breath out” that RDJr does mid sentence to let out his frustration when he was arguing with  Oppenheimer felt real asf. Processed
Amazing cast with great performances all around. Cilian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr all killed it. Cinematography and soundtrack were also amazing and the Trinity test and final scenes were both great. All in all a masterpiece. Nolan killed it with this one 👍 Processed
Really great film. First time watching any film in IMAX and phew, great experience. Every actor did justice to their role, loved Rami Malek attacking Strauss. The delay in audio and the focus on Oppenheimer’s breathing as the bomb detonated was sick and a great experience nonetheless. Processed
Here is the context of the “mermaid” quote from Dr. Rabi in the kangaroo court hearing, taken from the real-life transcript:

**MR. MARKS**: “Dr. Rabi, Mr. Robb asked you whether you had spoken to Chairman Strauss on behalf of Dr. Oppenheimer. Did you mean to suggest in your reply -- in your reply to him you said you did among other things -- did you mean to suggest that you had done that to Dr. Oppenheimer's instigation?”

**DR. RABI**: “No, I had no communication from Dr. Oppenheimer before these charges were filed, or since, except that I called him once to just say that I believed in him, with no further discussion. Another time I called on him and his attorney at the suggastion of Mr. Strauss. I never hid my opinion from Mr. Strauss that I thought that this whole proceeding was a most unfortunate one.”

**DR. EVANS**: “What was that?”

**DR. RABI**: “That the suspension of the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer was a very unfortunate thing and should not have been done. In other words, there he was; he is a consultant, and if you don't want to consult the guy, you don't consult him, period. Why you have to then proceed to suspend clearance and go through all this sort of thing, he is only there when called, and that is all there was to it. So it didn't seem to me the sort of thing that called for this kind of proceeding at all against a man who had accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has accomplished. There is a real positive record, the way I expressed it to a friend of mine. We have an A-bomb and a whole series of it, and we have a whole series of Super bombs and what more do you want, mermaids? This is just a tremendous achievement. If the end of that road is this kind of hearing, which can't help but be humiliating, I thought it was a pretty bad show. I still think so.” Processed
Fantastic direction and brilliant acting by Cillian Murphy. It's worth watching. Processed
[deleted] Processed
Incredible movie. Any time I watch a Christopher Nolan movie, I avoid all trailers and hype and wait till the day I see the movie to leave all expectations out. Cillian Murphy is the perfect man for the role and the supporting cast delivered. I will definitely plan to see it again. Right now I’m debating if this is the best movie Nolan ever made. I don’t know, but it feels like it. Processed
Just give Chrostopher Nolan the oscar. Give him all the damn oscars. What a film, absolutely monumental in scope and scale Processed
The editing in this movie is top notch. The 3 hours felt hypnotic and I couldn’t turn my head even for a second. 

The pacing was so snappy and the dialogues were being delivered like bullets. It was so fast. 

The build up to trinity test scene was just insane. My heart literally raced. 

I DID NOT expect to see Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman in this. That was truly a great surprise. Processed
I can't wait until Einstein popping up in random places becomes a meme Processed
I felt there were a couple of scenes where I lost track of the conversation....not as bad as some other Nolan films but still kind of frustrating. Processed
The Trinity test, the scene of Oppenheimer's anxiety in the gym and his final scene with Einstein are what stood out the most in this movie, absolute perfection in each case.

Definitely would recommend anyone to watch this. Processed
Saw it last night - no IMAX sadly :( Have to say I’m a little let down. I’m a massive Nolan fan but it felt too long with too many grey haired dudes whose names I couldn’t keep track of talking a lot. The moments where Nolan got to really flex his muscles when Oppy was trippin out were unbelievably intense and awesome. Bit disappointed by the explosion scene too - sorta was hoping for something more but not exactly sure what? Visually stunning, but an hour too long for the story it told Processed
•	3 hours of almost pure dialogue and you don’t get bored. Fast-paced and intense.

•	Cilian nails the contorted/twisted and mysterious nature of Oppenheimer very well. Was difficult to get a read on him sometimes.

•	Damon was amazing, tbh he always is. It’s difficult to separate him as a person from him on the screen more than other actors but he was great. Thought he was very funny and produced laugh out loud moments, my favourites being his deadpan “right, build him a town” and “we will have him killed.”

•	Score was amazing but that’s almost to be expected now with Nolan films

•	Blunt has a habit of stealing the limelight whenever she’s in a scene. Best one was where she wasn’t falling for the interrogator’s bullshit and stood up for herself/Oppy.

•	Scene with Cilian shagging on the interrogation chair with the woman staring at Blunt was pretty shocking. Not seen something like that in a Nolan before.

•	Bomb scene emotions: WTF why is there no sound?! Goddamn this is eerie as hell. Holy shit, there’s the sound – I need new pants. Whole cinema was packed but completely silent for this which added to it. 

•	Nolan knows the importance of the movie ending and this last scene was one of the better ones. Puts Einstein in colour then Cilian drops the bombshell at the end.

•	Didn’t know much about Oppy so had no idea where the movie would go after Hiroshima but the Downey Jnr storyline/twist was very good.

•	Gary Oldman cameo was great

•	Random thing I learned, the experiment lecturer in the room next to Oppy at the start (Josh Hartnett) turned down Nolan’s offer of being Batman. 

•	Enjoyed the marbles filling up in the bowl imagery of the bomb being ready

•	Harrowing scene where he gave the speech after the bombs were dropped in the raucous crowd one of the best ones. Processed
I loved a lot and disliked a lot

Pros: 
It was acted brilliantly. Cillian looking completely defeated as someone (can’t remember who) walked out of the interview room was great. 

the test’s buildup. The choice to delay the explosion 30 seconds was a brilliant one

The scenes with truman, the army deciding where to drop the bomb and cillian giving a speech were all magnificent.

cons

the test was really visually underwhelming. It looked like they’d blown up a little bit of dynamite not an atomic blast. should’ve gone CGI.

non linear nature of the film was hard to keep up with and i found it unnecessary 

Also found the political and security clearance element of the film to be a bit flat, not enough weight was put on oppenheimer not getting cleared for the audience to care. 

the Strauss storyline and his motivations were not made clear enough to the average viewer.

7/10 would recommend if you liked ww2 american politics and Nolan Processed
Probably one of the greatest final lines for a movie in my recent memory Processed
This movie had:  

- Heisenberg   

- New Mexico   

- A secret underground lab   

So you knew it was going to be awesome. Processed
This was the first movie I ever had to walk away and think about how I felt about it.

My immediate reaction was to wonder why there wasn't much shown or mentioned in terms of the Japanese people and what it did to them, but after sleeping on it it kind of all hit me.

Every significant character in this film is only viewing the events as they pertain to and affect themselves. Obviously this culminates with the mutually assured destruction motif of Strauss & Oppenheimer's careers going up in smoke. If anything had been added, such as an in memoriam, or some other nod to the dead it would have been vulgar. It would have seemed like insult to injury.

The only consideration is "can we build this" and "can we beat the soviets", never "what does this do to the world?"

Even Oppenheimer believes in the false dichotomy - "a peace the world has never seen..."

Again - it bothered me that something wasn't said but now I understand why it wasn't - because it just actually wasn't ever said or thought of at the time, and that's that the peace Oppenheimer is describing is not actually peace; it's Pax-Americana. Pax-Americana is not peace. It's managed peace under the threat of Imperialistic violence. The conditions for war are still there, but now there's a man with a big stick who won't let you fight it. That's not peace. No one says this because no one was even *thinking it at the time,* which is the entire point of the film. Everyone, including the US, sees themselves at the center, only viewing every event through the lens of how it affects *me personally,* and what *my place* in history will be. 

Other than that I just didn't get the tits, but great film! Processed
From Hibakusha, 

My husband and two children were lost in the atomic bombing.
I am Shige Hiratsuka, who was exposed to the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.As a live witness to the misery and anger, I would like to speak out.My family consisted of my husband, myself and two children…, a family of four.
On August 6, Showa 20 (1945), just after 8 am, we had just finished breakfast. As my husband was reading the morning paper, and I was cleaning up the breakfast dishes, our two children played nearby.
Suddenly, what seemed like a streak of lightning lit the sky, followed by a thunderous noise. The house collapsed around us, and we were trapped.

As my husband and I were trying with all our might to escape, we heard, "Help me! Help me!" Our next door neighbor's wife was calling for help. I called out to her, "As soon as we get free, we will come to help you!"

When we finally escaped from our fallen house, the first thing we saw was the total destruction of the city of Hiroshima. No houses or other buildings were visible. They had all disappeared. Fires were evident here and there. In my shock and fear, my only thought was escape. And, in my fear and rush to escape, I forgot the promise to help our neighbor's wife. My thoughts swirled around finding our children.

Where are our children?
As we called out our children's names, we heard, "Help me, Mother! Help me, Mother!", coming from a distance of about 2 or 3 meters away. I rushed in that direction. It was my own 6 year old daughter, Kazuko. I began calling for my husband who was at that time barely able to move. "Come quickly!" I screamed.
At that time my husband was bleeding from the shoulder and was badly injured. He was so weak that he was barely able to walk.
Our daughter was screaming out, "Mother, my legs hurt, my legs hurt! My legs are trapped. Help me to get them free!"
I struggled to free her, but no matter how hard I pulled, her legs remained trapped. She was covered from the chest down by debris from the walls of the house and by dirt. It was impossible to free her.

As I continued to pull on her, the fires were fast approaching. I could see and hear and smell the fires. I was hot and unable to breathe, and could no longer continue my struggle. At that moment, I knew that if I stayed I would die. Dying was not a choice I was willing to make. I could not imagine being burned to death.

I said a prayer for my children.
"Kazu-chan, I am sorry. I am a bad mother. Please forgive me. Kazu-chan, I know you don't want to die, either, but your Mother does not have courage to face the fire. Kazu-chan, forgive me, forgive me!" I said as I turned and walked toward the area that was free of fire. I took my husband's hand to help him escape with me, but as we moved away, our hearts were left behind with our daughter.

As we escaped, we didn't realize that we were stepping and falling over dead bodies. As I stumbled and fell on those bodies, I was not affected by a feeling of creepiness. I just felt a deep sadness. As we continued our escape, we realized that we had made it to the riverside of Yokokawa. Processed
Got to see this in 70mm Imax and Jesus Christ it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I'd forgotten how great it is just to see close-ups of faces projected on the biggest screen possible. 

Some of the courtroom/hearing scenes looked as if they were filmed in the mid 70s. Absolutely gorgeous to look at.

And the sound was just unbelievable. I got a jolt through my entire body everytime an explosion went off. And to build up to Trinity and then drop us into complete silence gave me chills.

The scene afterwards where Oppenheimer tries to give a rousing speech and is haunted by Hiroshima was one of the most disturbing and powerful scenes I can remember. Truly like being in a nightmare, especially the way screams bled and bombs began bleeding into the soundtrack. Truly haunting.

I thought all the cast was great. Murphy's never been better, it was great to see Downey Jr given a meaty acting role for once, Damon has settled into the gruff old man phase of his career, Blunt really stole the last hour, and I loved all the brief cameos from big stars.

Only downsides: The first hour was a bit shapeless and dragged at times, Pugh was very good but her character felt like she needed one or two more scenes to really land, some of the dialogue is very heavy handed (they get away with it because it's so fast and often technical, but a lot of this film is verbal exposition). 

But they are small issues in an incredible 3 hour film that I could have easily sat and watched for another hour at least. Excellent, excellent film. Processed
This would have made for a great HBO mini series, as a movie it was a little all over the place. Processed
Oppenheimer made me want to go back to school to get a PhD in physics and write equations in my room for 4 years straight while Ludwig's soundtrack plays on repeat. 

Ludwig Goransson’s track played nearly the entire movie and had me sweating the entire time with its sheer intensity. His testosterone-fueled, aggressive tracks mixed traditional orchestra with synths while quieter orchestral motifs enhanced the emotional connections. Ludwig was so committed that he started writing 3 months before filming began and continued throughout production. In "Can you hear the Music," Ludwig changes the tempo 21 times so drastically and aggressively that the track was deemed unplayable, the musicians in the full orchestra required a click played in their headphones before every tempo change, and it took 3 days until the entire song was finally recorded in one take. 

The editing matched Ludwig's level of intensity and focus. Nolan kept slamming scene after scene without giving us a second to breathe. This was phenomenal, focused, nonlinear editing. The entire movie was composed of thematic clusters of linked montages and vignettes which flowed naturally and felt like a dream. The brief cuts to particles vibrating, atoms splitting, bombs exploding, and stars collapsing were incredible visuals to complement the physics concepts discussed. The feverish pace was complemented by the music perfectly. Processed
Saw it last night. Liked it overall but not without faults that I noticed while watching the movie.

 I felt like an old man during the opening scenes. I struggled to hear what the hell they were saying due to the music drowning out the dialogue. 

 The trinity test scene was cool, I loved the tense buildup and then silence. Going completely against what most people were expecting. 

 That scene where Einstein just emerged from the darkness on the lawn made me laugh. I thought it was ridiculous and he felt very shoehorned in to that moment. 

 Oppenheimer mentions the Bhagavad Gita while having sex and I thought “christ, here we go”, and then he said it, and my eyes nearly rolled out of my head. 

 Lots of fun moments like the cut aways to small physical reactions, a who’s who of all the scientists involved (Benny Safdie as Teller was really good) and that sublime whale song of a score are all the standouts to me. Processed
watching it in imax (not 70mm imax, that one was too far away) i felt all the explosions down to the very core

and during the *big* explosion it felt like the theatre was about to collapse it shook so much Processed
Can anyone explain the significance of the B&W scenes? I know it’s jumping around in the timeline of how things happen, but I can’t figure out what the turning point of when in the timeline it switches to black and white. Towards the beginning of the movie, I thought everything in B&W was post-trinity test, but the color footage also extends into the board interrogation scenes which is well past Trinity as well. Processed
The ending though. Amazing and depressing Processed
the movie feels like it could've been one of Oppenheimer's bad dreams where he recalls all the traumatic events he's been through.

Mixing in his guilt and anxiety made him dream things out of order, but it's grouped together by how he felt at the different events. Processed
Sat for 3 hours and I still need to sit down after that gut punch of an ending. May be my favorite thing Nolan's done. At least neck-and-neck with Dunkirk. Processed
This isn't the type of movie I would normally see, especially not in theaters, but with so much hype and talent behind it I had to go. 

I didn't even realize how stacked and massive the cast was, but damn did they nail it. The make up team also needs credit because I didn't realize that was RDJ until he spoke.

Aside from a couple slow parts and a little confusion from the jumping around in time periods, I very much enjoyed the movie and would recommend it. Processed
Did anyone else see a hand with a black glove holding Jeans head under the water? was there any suspicion around her death? Processed
More I think about it the "Can you hear the music, Robert?" sequence might be my favorite scene in the whole film and one of my favorites in Nolan's filmography. It's Nolan going full tone-poem. Watching Oppenheimer study abroad inter-cut with shots from the quantum world, as this ethereal and dream-like score plays. Ludwig Göransson score during this montage is his best of the entire film. I love the tempo of the scene. The way it seems to pulsate as Oppenheimer shatters glasses in the corner of his room. It's such a moody scene. There's this kind of romanticism to it. The abstract portrait Oppenheimer stares at seemingly a reflection of himself.  It's somehow very much like Nolan yet almost completely different than any of the other scenes he's directed. I love it so much. Processed
Did I miss them or did we get an act 1 - fission... And then never another one? Processed
The real story and the viewers pov is that of Robert Downey Jrs.

I felt like the essential question of the film was determining whether Oppenheimer was truly against the development of nuclear bombs and the Hydrogen bomb because of their destructive capabilities. Or whether he was against it because he was jealous that he didn't come up with the idea for the hydrogen bomb.

The entire movie is moreso about the judgment of his character rather than his achievement. 

Did he really care to see the world burn? Or did he just want to see it done by his own hands?

That was what the movie was about imo. And we come to that essential question via the last couple scenes in the movie with Downey jr's character determining oppie's motivation and oppie's last scene with Einstein that Nolan made up. Processed
It feels like Florence Pugh is in _everything_ atm.

It made me laugh a bit when her character said that she is "complicated" - i felt that was just a polite way of trying make being an absolute arsehole acceptable. Processed
Movie really didn't work for me, and that isn't a surprise as I couldn't finish tenet. 

The editing was frantic most of the time, and needlessly so. The story being told primarily out of chronological order was an odd choice given the type of story they are telling. It feels like at least an hour or more of the movie could have been removed without it having much impact. 

The confirmation of RDJ's character wasn't necessary and watching them put Oppenheimer on trial for keeping his security clearance didn't feel as climatic as it likely intended to. It also didn't need to be as remotely long as it was.

Choosing not to show any of the aftermath of the bomb drops was a bad choice in my opinion. Having them simply talked about in some throwaway lines really didn't do it justice. 

Also the only two performances that stood out were RDJ and Matt Damon. Not that anyone else was bad, just a bit one note. That seems especially true for Murphy, given how much praise he received I expected a bit more.

I think this could have been a great movie if Nolan stopped being Nolan a bit while filming it. Processed
Before watching Oppenheimer I feel like there was just as many articles about the Florence Pugh sex scenes as there were reviews of the movie itself.

So I was really surprised that the only nudity is Florence Pugh's breasts. All these articles made it out to be like there would be some full-frontal, graphic sex scenes.

Also, the only actual "sex/penetration" only lasts for like 5 seconds total.

I'm really surprised this movie has an R rating. It got an R rating solely for showing breasts??? I feel like in Europe with its more liberal stance towards sex and nudity, this movie easily could be rated PG.

Even the woman's face peeling off (the only "gore" in the movie - if you can even call it that), only lasted for like 2 seconds tops. And that wasn't even gory even, someone with a bad sunburn and their skin peeling off would literally have the same special effects... Processed

I was a bit confused about Lewis Strauss’ aide at the end. Did his attitude toward Strauss shift towards hatred/distrust/disappointment after realizing Strauss was a thin-skinned conniving snake? That’s what it felt like (and it seemed fairly clear to me), given his feigned ignorance to the way congress was leaning and providing false info to Strauss, but I just wasn’t sure given that Strauss was his boss and all. Also, did he personally take any action into getting Hill to testify in the manner in which he did? Or was Hill always going to slander Strauss from the start? Processed

Very very good movie. I was worried to fall asleep because nowdays I have problem with two hour movie, but it went by in a flash, I was shocked it was already over then I watch the phone and it was 12:30.

The acting is top notch, the pacing is phenomenal. The fast cut was confusing at first but then it became really organic.

I think it's just so nice to have filmmaker like Nolan who never miss, you go to see one of his movies and you know it's gonna be a good experience.

Is it just me, but I felt like the focus of the movie was completely wrong? Like the personal quarrel of Strauss is a far far less interesting conflict than anything relating to the building of atomic bomb, yet the movie was exclusively focusing on it. I would have liked to see more of the science, more moral dilemma, more about how the bomb was built and what it took. The Strauss character and his beef with Oppenheimer felt like a C-story that Nolan focused far too much on. Would have liked to see more scenes with scientists and Teller. The movie had way too many supporting characters who only appear for a scene or two. The more abstract scenes and the internal struggle part fel more interesting than seeing the same board room meeting again. Nolan always had an exposition problem, but now he turned his entire movie into exposition and I don't feel like that solved anything. Processed
The comments make me think that a lot of people paid to watch a three hour movie, and all they wanted to see was a bomb go off. 

I thought it was 9/10. Amazing performances, score, visuals. I don’t mind long movies, so no issue there. The intro scene with the Prometheus quote, and the finale were gripping, as well as the test scene. I thought the Sanskrit sex scene was silly, I also didn’t like the fast edits and cuts. It was faster paced than a typical Nolan film, but I understand why it had to be, otherwise it would’ve been five hours long. Processed
This is one of Nolan’s movies that I think was *hurt* by the non-linearity of the story. Felt forced in just because Nolan feels obligated to do so. Processed
Completely blown away by the movie. Avoided all the traps I thought it'd fall into, and went way further than I thought.

I recently went through both The Making of the Atomic Bomb, American Prometheus (and some Feynman books for good measure), and holy wow did they get so much right. So much dialogue is taken exactly out of actual quotes, and any artistic liberties / events shuffled around more or less still capture the history (e.g. it wasn't Kitty that refused to shake Teller's hand, but Robert Christy, at some other event). Even got Feynman and his friggin bongos. I almost feel like you're missing out if you haven't gotten more background with the books before going into the movie, like being to able to point out individual scientists and other characters and what role they played in making the bomb and the hearings. Processed

Aside from a slight dip of momentum at perhaps the 70% mark (a bit after the test), the film felt overall well-paced. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Performances were excellent all-around. It was actually Matt Damon and Alden Ehrenreich that surprised the most. The former being so ubiquitous but he managed to quickly disappear into the role of Groves, an at times jocular but mostly no-b.s. personality that demonstrates managerial competence. The latter making the most of this post-Solo opportunity and selling the evolution of his alarmed understanding of Strauss's actual motivations.

Movie was also a relatively "light" R. The scenes with Jean are few and not that explicit. The scene with him reading the quote to her during intimacy is not as absurd as it sounded, mainly because he himself is apparently wondering "is she really doing this?" as it starts before cutting to the next scene. His imagined effects of the bomb were not very vividly shown either. That and an F-word iirc from Kitty and that's about it for rating purposes.

Finally, the bomb sequence was exquisitely presented but was treated as the mid-point of greater political machinations (and H-bombs) that came before and after. Looking forward to seeing it again. Processed
Can someone explain all the Strauss 3rd act stuff to me Processed

Another absolute stunner from Christopher Nolan! The only annoying thing was the fact that some dialogues are so difficult to hear! I watched it yesterday and found certain parts challenging to comprehend - not just the discussions about neutrons and protons!

Sound effects and soundtrack were beautiful and amazing, but I always feel a bit slightly "disregarded" when I can't clearly hear the dialogue in a film. 

It's a masterpiece and a 9/10, but I just ask for clearer audio on dialogues on Nolan's movies hahah Processed

Okay, is it just me or was anyone else bothered by the occasional "close-up shot where the subject's face is slightly out of focus"?!?

i just wanna take a moment and appreciate the masterfully crafted sound design it's breath taking hats off to Ludwig Göransson. 👏🏻🙏🏻💯 Processed
Does anyone have any thoughts on how Oppenheimer was brought down by his own countrymen after such an achievement. Felt to me as if Nolan was hammering home how the American government don't want there to be any real superstars out there and that at the end of the day the government are always the top dogs Processed
I saw it in IMAX and was mostly able to make out the dialogue.

The one scene I couldn't get that I really wanted to was when Oppenheimer (and the more menschy Jewish guy, I think) met Heisenberg.

Did Heisenberg say or insinuate something sinister? It felt like he did (this being Germany shortly before the Nazi takeover) but I couldn't make it out.

I just got that Oppenheimer was homesick and wanted to go back to New Mexico. Processed
I realized half way through that movie I exist because this project was successful. My grandfather was already fighting in Japan. He more than likely would have died if the USA invaded the mainland. It started to hit different after than realization. Processed
The movie was gorgeous in 70mm IMAX but I'm pretty sure it gave me hearing loss. I finished it 4h ago and I'm still nursing a headache. Way too loud in my theater, and yet at the same time, half of the dialogue was unintelligible. For a lot of the movie I only got the "vibe" of the Oppenheimer hearings and scenes with Strauss, but hardly had any idea what they were actually talking about.

It also felt like a very Nolan film. The man really hates to tell a story in sequence. Most of the characters are exposition vessels. But the imagery, the depiction of anxiety, the scenes with Einstein, Oppenheimer's inner conflict are all very well rendered. Processed
Lucky enough to live a short drive from one of the handful of places showing it in 70mm and managed to go yesterday morning. It was my first time seeing the film so I don't know how it actually compares to a standard showing, but when I think about other filmgoing experiences I've had, I really think seeing it in a massive format added something to the experience. At least for me. Yeah, it's a lot of people sitting around rooms talking, but I was completely taken in. It grabbed my attention long before Los Alamos and I was so thoroughly enthralled that by the time it ended I honestly wasn't expecting it to be over and was amazed that three hours had gone by. (The fact that the movie jumps around a lot and seemingly has a near-constant score probably helps keep the sense of momentum on this front) It's been a day and so much of it still sticks with me.

was i an idiot for thinking that the Oppenheimer private questioning and strauss public conference thing was happening at the same time? completely missed that the strauss stuff happened in subsequent years until i read these comments Processed
Going into this, I knew about the security clearance hearings but not about Stross. Towards the end I was really worried Stross had gotten away with leading that witchhunt bullshit.

So happy that he didn't. Was also happy to read on Wikipedia that what he did to Oppenheimer followed him and Teller for the rest of their careers, and Stross in particular remained bitter about it until the day he died. Processed

Saw this right after Barbie and it was just amazing. The scene after the bomb was dropped on hiroshima, when oppenheimer is succumb to the enormous guilt and thoughts of the lives taken by the bomb is just astounding. The mix of cheering and hollow screams as he finds the words to share with these people that adore him for something so horrible. Processed
I still can't get over how good Downey was. Certainly was critical of his Tony Stark 'schtick' by the end of the MCU run, but eating crow big time. He played such a great role in this movie. Processed
I hear everyone saying they were bored after the Trinity explosion, but some of the best acting in the film occured after that. Oppenheimer's life was very complex and he was extremely vilified after Trinity, so there was no real way to sugarcoat that entire aspect of his life. He pretty much spent his entire life after Trinity trying to absolve himself from what happened, so I'm not sure what people were expecting after the blast happened in the movie. Processed
Can't stand how omnipresent the score is in this, as it is in most Nolan films I guess. It's a great score but man turn it down during some dialogue lmao Processed
This movie is a testament to the importance of and artistry behind sound design.

I don’t think a scene in a drama has ever made me feel as disgusted as the people cheering and celebrating after learning a bomb they helped create murdered so so many innocent people. I’ve seen comments of people upset that the Japanese people affected by the atrocities weren’t featured, but I think it’s almost more powerful to show that the only way Oppenheimer was made to feel remorse was to imagine the impact he had in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on his own people. Oppenheimer never saw the direct consequences of his actions in Japan. To my knowledge he never even visited Hiroshima or Nagasaki. 

Also to see that would have been too much even for a movie like this. 

I do agree that there could have been a place in the movie for the local Hispano populations of New Mexico and the devastation the testing in Los Alamos caused.

Overall I was a huge fan of the cinematography (which felt especially refreshing for me after watching the recent Mission Impossible), visual effects, sound design, and soundtrack. 

The ending felt poignant and the movie was as horrifying and unsettling as a movie like this needs to be Processed
I’m not sure how a movie can be so thrilling and boring at the same time, but here we are. I kept wanting to look at my watch after the Trinity test. Processed
Gonna be honest their where so many big actors playing tiny parts that everytime I saw them it took me out of the movie, like anyone could’ve been cast to play half of the Scientists and it wouldn’t of made me go “oh look it rami malek and Josh from drake and Josh” Processed
Simultaneously a cinematic masterpiece and a depressing introspection of mankind's propensity for destruction. I need a drink. Processed
I'm always a little hesitant to contribute to huge movie threads like this one that already has 8K comments, but might as well add my two cents for posterity.

This film is an absolute technical masterpiece, but strangely I don't feel it quite lived up to the hype, at least the hype I had built up in my own mind. Nolan is obviously a master and made sure that everyone involved with his film is the absolute best at what they do. Along with the direction, it had fantastic acting from everyone (shout-out to Benny Safdie), Oscar-worthy cinematography from Hoyte, another great score from Ludwig, solid VFX, and almost perfect editing. 

Like many other modern movies, I felt it was a touch too long. The third act felt more like an epilogue and it started to drag when the kangaroo court and Strauss confirmation hearing was being wrapped up. If the run time was condensed to around 2:30 or even 2:40, I think it would've made a world of difference. 

I think Nolan did a great job of balancing who Oppenheimer was as a person with the significance of what he was called to do. I also really liked how he constantly kept asking the moral questions behind the Manhattan Project without lecturing the audience (at least until the very end, and even then only a bit). I personally would've liked to hear more of the science and the technical struggles that went on. As an analogue, I really liked the scenes in Hidden Figures and First Man when we saw about how challenges presented themselves and how the team overcame them.

Regardless of my mostly minor gripes, this movie delivered in almost every way and left me very satisfied.  I'd put this Nolan entry squarely in the middle of the pack of his oeuvre.   8/10 Processed
GARY FUCKING OLDMAN Processed
I did NOT realize Harry Truman was played by Gary Oldman until checking the cast Processed
Well my Barbenheimer weekend is complete. And holy shit. Oppenheimer. I’ve never had a 3 hour movie fly by like that. The pacing and underscoring were incredible. Just so so good. Processed
For such a long film with almost zero breathing room when it comes to a constant barrage of narrative information, I left the theatre baffled by how little information there is when it comes to character motivation.

Why did Teller turn on Oppenheimer when it was Oppenheimer who stood up for him in front of the other scientists, repeatedly? Why did Borden accept the role in producing that accusatory letter when he himself wasn't shown being involved with the whole affair previously (what's in it for him)? Is Strauss' motivation (and hence the whole third act) really just a result of that single radioisotope event? (Strauss even went as far as recruiting Oppenheimer initially, so clearly he admired him?)

This is all from just viewing the film itself. I'm sure you could get better understanding from actually reading up the history but — that defeats the point of a biopic, no? Processed
This movie was just a little too long for me considering how ridiculously uncomfortable the IMAX theater seats were holy hell like leaning against metal the whole time.

Everything was awesome but I was a bit disappointed in the actual nuclear test. There were quite  a few scenes that looked very good but almost all the shots used looked like completely different blasts. There was a wide shot where it was clear it was a very small explosion and another where the fireball was really weird and skinny. I don't know the whole editing showcase of that scene felt really off and I personally think that CGI would have been a better alternative. It simply didn't look like the Trinity test at all and it's not like it would have been impossible to recreate considering the nature of that nuclear explosion.

Other than that and some really strange sex scenes it was awesome. Processed
Did anyone not like it?   


I personally did not like the non-linear structure of the film.  The way that Nolan tried to spin Strauss's betrayal as suspense was lackluster and off-putting . Firstly, the structure really just made the trial lack build-up. Practically, the last ten minutes or so is where things unfold haphazardly. Almost trying to piece together a cop-out climactic surprise villain ending. Then 'thematic' suspense  is just off-putting for what it was trying to do, create a complex view of Oppenheimer. By the end, he was just doing Spielberg's school of Heroes vs Villain. Strauss, very bad man. Oppenheimer, complex but mostly good. Its too simplified for comfort. The use of time could have been more effective in showing the change that the film aims to show with Oppenheimer's view of the bomb to be honest. 

It had more success in telling the pre-trial Oppenheimer. I think its much more successful in creating the enigma of Oppenheimer. You could see him weak, uncompromising, a bit psychotic, and just a tad bit hypocritical. I felt that some portion can be edited down clearly, especially the Communist period or the pre-Alamo days, which was while important in the trial, does not really hold any weight once told verbally. It is what it is, people he had knew. The relationship between his wife and him could have been the better choice to focus on.  The three hours is not entirely necessary for the film to be honest.   


Otherwise, the  film is marvelous and well-crafted. I think Cillian, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Safdie were noteworthy in the film. The story could definitely had be tweaked. 3/5. Processed
OVERALL SO GOOD!!

My fav parts:

* Score was fantastic and did an amazing job building up and creating the feeling of anxiety and dread that this movie succeeded at instilling me with
* The Lewis Strauss reveal

My least fav parts:

* Small nitpick but was Oppy his real-life nickname? Something about it throws me off so bad every time I hear it
* The Bhagavad Gita quote. This disappointed me because I didn't expect to be said while he was literally boinking, and only for the "now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds". I was expecting the full excerpt to be said and done in a moment of reflection rather than a pseudo-serious sex scene. My naive brain thought they might've actually shown the real video but that probably wouldn't happen. Nonetheless, the Bhagavad Gita scene was a bit tasteless for my preference.

9/10 film for me! Maybe even 9.5! Maybe even 10! Processed
After seeing it again im more frustrated with people saying it should have explored more of the impact on Japan and the people. This was an Oppenheimer biopic not a WW2 movie. 

The whole point was not the consequences of the nuclear bomb that went off in Japan but the consequences of nuclear bombs just existing. And I think they explored that perfectly. Incredible ending and it's still 5/5 for me. Processed

Saw this last night and loved it. I'm neither a fan or hater of Nolan, but I do like his movies, so I knew I would at least like this one, but it really hit all the right buttons for me. I was honestly surprised at how much I loved it, I went in thinking "okay, incredibly stacked cast but it's three hours long and from what I hear, lots of talking, I'm prepared to be impressed but bored" and by the time it was over I was thinking "that was incredible and I can't wait to watch it again." I went on cheap night at my local theatre, it was packed, lots of weird energy, people fidgeting, being really loud for the first 15-20 minutes, but within a half hour the whole theatre was silent, and I didn't see one person walk out or even go to the washroom, on the way out everyone was talking about now much they loved it, just overhearing those conversations is one of the things I love about going to the movies, sharing those moments with strangers.  

Performances were all top notch, Cillian was incredible, shoe in for at least a best actor nomination (still too early to call that) and it was so nice to see Robert Downey Jr. doing interesting work again, not knocking the MCU, but it feels like he's been Iron Man for the last decade or so, and he really nailed his role. Benny Safdie was a nice surprise too, loved him in Good Time. Emily Blunt was really great too, no weak links in the cast in my opinion.  

Still wrapping my head around it all and reading reviews from more eloquent folks, and even some very valid criticism, any film that starts discussion is good in my books. Processed
Saw it in 70mm IMAX in Indy today. Theatre was absolutely full. What a delight. Processed
I have been hearing from people that it glorifies the entire Atomic Bomb / Hiroshima / Nagasaki thing. But I went to watch it and didn't get that (glorification) impression at all. Also some comments from friends who found it "so american" are kind of weird to me after watching it myself. Comparing it for example to the Pearl Harbor movie, which I found very Americanized, this was art.        
    
Having said that, this was my first IMAX 70mm experience, and while it is impressive, I did have some issues with understanding dialogue due to, in my opinion, bad sound mixing. I seem to be not the only one, and that it is kind of a Nolan thing to do, so I might just have to see it again once it gets a streaming release.    
    
Not a bad movie, but maybe expected a bit more from it. Or... maybe not expect more, but expect something different. I need to let it sink in for a bit I think Processed

As a physicist (well biophysicist but still), this movie felt like Nolan's love letter to science. So many little details about scientists in there, showing their fragile egos, their tribalistic nature, their petty squabbles yet ability to band together, loved it. Loved all the cameos, Bethe, Feynman, Godel, Alvarez, Szilard and so on. But I do wonder, for someone not super into science history or not a scientist, how much of any these would you catch? Feels very specific lol. Processed
My theory is Oppenheimer is the main villain in the story. Even though Strauss has personal vendetta against Oppenheimer, I believe it was tried to be portrayed as true when he says Oppenheimer would build the bomb without thinking again knowing everything, to be the most important man. Oppenheimer feels guilty, but does the guilt overtakes his desire to be the center of attention? Nolan doesn’t make it clear, maybe intentionally. Processed
Ik the movie has split opinions, but I simply can't get get the movie out of my head and the main reason I keep coming back to this thread is how engaged I was throughout the runtime. Plus it's interesting to see the different views. Processed
Someone in my viewing giggled at the “stripes were embedded in their skin from their clothing” (I’m paraphrasing). I thought it was a disgusting thing to laugh at and makes me wish that they showed the after effects of the bombs in Japan. I’m glad they didn’t have a scene of the bombing itself, but it would be interesting to have more of the after effects shown to truly portray the horror of the bomb and to shut up those who laugh at it. Processed
Loved the movie. Please can someone explain why the last 3rd of film was important ie the trial- that wasnt a trial- to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance. Was it losing that security clearance really so terribly devastating to Oppenheimer ? More devastating than witnessing the horror he had unleashed? I really struggle to understand the directors intention. Did it give our emotions a bit of a pause before the anguish of the final scene with Einstein? So may lives ruined by Mcarthyism that Oppenheimer losing his clearance was not exceptional. Processed
sorry if this has been discussed and I just missed it, but the part during the break in the security hearing where oppenheimer and Rabi are in the hall and Oppenheimer is eating the orange, what happened in the interaction with Ernest Lawrence? I didn’t understand that. Processed
What I'm learning is that Alden Ehrenreich thrives in 1950s period pieces about McCarthyism and the Red Scare. Processed
Alden Ehrenreich was great in this. I still think it's scummy how Lord and Miller threw him under the bus by blaming their dysfunctional Solo set on his acting (At least through the press). Processed
I have to rewatch it. I enjoyed it but I feel like I missed a lot. The constant cutting back and forth between time periods, plethora of actors, accents, characters…it was really hard to follow for me. Plus, the dialogue was hard to hear sometimes. The background was so loud.

Good movie, though Processed
There’s something funny about the fact to me that Josh Nichols set off the bomb. Processed
I find it really interesting how Oppenheimer was probably inspired in his work by art, with the scene of the Picasso painting, probably under the desire that his work would be seen or compared to art.

Only to realise that throughout the film his work was used for destruction and death. Processed
Damon had a few really good one liners. Was a necessary comic relief at time. Processed
Random aside, one of Herbert Hoover's last words was about Lewis Strauss. Someone mentioned him and Hoover (90 and not all there) said "I met Levi Strauss!" Only reason I knew who he was at the start Processed
Ah. Wasn't there a line about two scorpions that maybe alludes to this? Processed
> “Maybe they were talking about something more… important”
> 
> What a great “go fuck yourself” moment. All the self-importance just gone


To me that felt more than just a "fuck you moment" but sort-of the message of the movie about not basking in self-importance. Einstein tells Oppenheimer after that scene that when people give him awards and medals, they don't give them to him but to themselves.

Edit: a letter. Processed
The scary thing is a lot of people are like Strauss. They take imaginary offence thinking you’re out to get them then get super vindictive against you, when you didn’t do anything. Processed
Alden killed it to! Processed
I loved that moment. He was so paranoid over something so relatively small (pun intended) and lost everything because of it. Mutually assured destruction and it was his fault Processed
Some directors have that pull, Wes Anderson and Tarantino are the same. Just been in a Nolan film even if it's a 5 minute role, is something as a actor you want to tick off the bucket list. Processed
I thought Casey Affleck was riveting in his one major scene. He looked like he wanted to rip Oppenheimer's skin off. Processed
>Gary Oldman

For fucks sake, I just found out he played Truman. That fucking chameleon keeps fooling me! Processed
Rami was perfect casting. He's a born character actor, such a jarring presence on screen, steals the movie when he leans into stuff like this Processed
I made the decision to take a proactive piss around 1 hour in. I could tell there wasn't going to be a "good time" to go so I figured better earlier than later Processed
SOMEBODY IN MY THEATER MISSED THE TRINITY TEST FOR THE BATHROOM Processed
Bring back the intermission. Processed
Truman: …..pussy Processed
Teller is like “I would fucking do it again”


😂 Processed
Safdie as Teller might be the best performance in the film. Processed
He definitely could too, his got a convincing Russian accent Processed
Totally agree. Even Matt Damon’s character seems genuinely frightened of what he is capable of, and Casey nails it with his nonverbal acting, and Cillian nails the unnerved reaction. Fantastically tense scene. Processed
Funny part is if anyone else was playing Oppenheimer I think that role would be locked in for Cillian Murphy. Processed
The movie does an excellent job of showing what it’s like to be around these crazy military people and politicians Processed
I don't which one he was in the movie. Was he the one who interrogated Oppie and was called as the guy who later genocided the bosheviks or something? Processed
The water motif in this movie was fantastic Processed
This was literally the Avengers for theoretical physicists Processed
I like that they sneaked Richard Feynman in. I mean, *who else* would be playing the bongos at the first nuclear detonation? Processed
wait gödel was in this?? Processed
stop! i'm going to detonate 😖 Processed
I still can't believe Nolan had Oppenheimer's most iconic quote introduced right after he was done nailing Florence Pugh, what a madlad. Processed
The internet said there would be dong but I’ve seen the movie twice now and NO DONG. 😔 Processed
It was so weird she “got off the horse, ” talked about his books, then got back on. Like who has sex like that Processed
the destroyer of dicks Processed
"You don't get to commit the sin and then have the rest of us feel sorry for you for there being consequences." Processed
What struck me about the line is it applied not only to the immediate turmoil but also the larger conflict within Oppenheimer Processed
It reminded me of a brilliant line for Carmela in the Sopranos

“You are putting me in a position to feel sorry for a whore who fucks you?”

Very similar situation too. Tony’s goomar attempts suicide Processed
apparently he was even worse irl

He called Oppenheimer a “cry-baby scientist” and said, “I don't want to see that son of a b–– in this office ever again.” Processed
Going from Roosevelt to Truman is such a crazy change in personalities, not quite JFK->LBJ, but still. Processed
I was absolutely sobbing uncontrollably when he's acknowledging the crowd that are cheering and saying how the only regret he has is not being able to use it earlier while internally everything is silent and he is contemplating the destruction of the bomb. Emotionally draining sequence right there. One of the most memorable and deep emotional moment I have felt in a movie theater. Processed
The Trinity test sequence is incredible, but that gymnasium scene is my favorite in the film. Gut-wrenching. Having the two back to back makes for the best 20-25 minutes you'll have in a theater this year. Processed
Honestly, this movie basically feels like who I imagined Nolan would be after I watched Memento back in the day. Instead, that guy detoured into Batman and big action thrillers and so they gave that guy 100 million to shoot this on IMAX film. Processed
A lesser biopic would have ended with the real Oppenheimer’s “I am become death, destroyer of worlds” speech. That didn’t happen here. Processed
A frightening scene that was needed. It’s still shocking to me that a lot of people don’t understand that a nuclear warhead being used means we’re all absolutely fucked. Processed
that scene gave me absolute chills. once the movie ended my whole theater seemed to be a little shaken up by that especially. a completely full theater that during the previews seemed ready to cheer and have reactions to the movie became dead silent because of how tense the movie was. Processed
In the beginning of the movie we started with just one ripple as Einstein was throwing rocks in the water but at the end it was the entire pond as the rain fell. Processed
The best part is... it's factually accurate. Whole parts of that scene were actual quotes.

>“Chairman Gray: “Would it be fair to say that Dr. Oppenheimer’s contributions in the years as late as possibly 1942 meant that he had not stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party? I don’t insist that you answer that yes or no. You can answer that any way you wish.”

> Kitty Oppenheimer: “I know that. Thank you. I don’t think that the question is properly phrased.”

> Chairman Gray: “Do you understand what I am trying to get at?”

> Kitty: “Yes; I do.”

> Chairman Gray: “Why don’t you answer it that way?”

> Kitty: “The reason I don’t like the phrase ‘stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party.’ . . . It is because I don’t think Robert ever had anything to do with the Communist Party as such. I know he gave money for Spanish refugees; I know he gave it through the Communist Party.”

>[...]

>Kitty did not give an inch. Not even Robb could touch her. Calm and yet alert to every nuance, she was undoubtedly a better witness than the husband she was defending.

(Excerpt from American Prometheus) Processed
crowd was absolutely loving it. at first it felt like a thankless role but she really comes to play in the second half i thought Processed
Jason Clarke plays a great weasel so it was even more satisfying to watch his character get completely dismantled. Pugh didn’t get much in this movie, but Blunt got that excellent scene along with the last hour of the movie. Processed
My movie theater went silent it was noticeable. It was silent before, but people were moving in their seat eating popcorn/drinking and it felt like time stopped for that minute. Really weird and amazing feeling at the same time. Processed
And by being damning, it was even more humanizing, in the best and most complex way. Awesome stuff. It feels reductive to even categorize this as biopic, but as biopics go, this already has to be one of the most compelling, smart, and sensitive Processed
Reminded me of when the boom hit everyone at the Trinity test. The delay of being in the moment and having the realization of reality hitting you, and BOOM Processed
It's the biopic cinematic universe.
The bcu. Processed
"JFK will return." Processed

The start of the 20th century American History Cinematic Universe Processed
It made me think of when they reveal Robin’s name at the end of Dark Knight Rises😂 Processed
He's got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

But also, JFK's most famous triumph/fumble was all on the brink of nuclear war Processed
"Take this new senator. He's got a taste for theatrics like you."

"I'll look into it." Processed
And Einstein appeared behind the car like Captain America in the avengers. Processed
the kennedy initiative Processed
The guy behind me actually went “Oh shit!!” When that happened and I laughed my ass off! Processed
IDK about anyone else, I absolutely love Damon, but I tend to always have trouble separating his characters from him. Like every time he's in any scene in any movie by brain won't stop saying "Hey look it's Matt Damon lol!" - like he's a meme created by nature. Processed
Damon is so great and he usually is, it’s amazing how good everyone else was that Damon is taken for granted. Truth be told, I’m amazed that he didn’t even come up in my discussion with my friends on the way out. Processed
Brilliant ending Processed
That’s when I knew, she had my vote for the Oscar nomination. I mean everyone just acted their assess off. Processed
Blunt carried her own weight in this movie. When she was frustrated about Oppenheimer's naivete, I felt that to my bone. Despite being an alcoholic, her nose was razor sharp on the bullshit. Processed
Yeah in the first act especially I couldn’t help thinking damn the pacing is just ripping along for a 3 hour story Processed
That was a perfect fuck you moment. Rami Malek’s character coming in clutch at the senator’s hearing was fantastic. Processed
that was one of the best moments, revealing just how different the antagonist is from the protagonist Processed
Yes, it’s ambiguous Processed
there are theories that she may have been murdered, possibly by intelligence, etc. The movie makes it ambiguous Processed
To this day, there are still questions about her death. Drowning oneself in a bathtub is a very unique way to go, and because of her connections to Oppenheimer and the Communist Party, theories mention murder rather than suicide. Processed
Yes, it was suspected she was murdered. Processed
Yeah it was implied along with unsigned suicide note. Processed
Great ending Processed
*music swells* Processed
I didn’t know half the cast was gonna be in it. I went to a private screening with only some friends Wednesday night and I swear every time someone showed up I’d just say “Oh Dane DeHaan’s in this? Oh Josh Peck’s in this? Oh Rodrick Heffley’s in this?” Processed
Man- that random scream while the clapping faded- I thought I imagined that. That was fucking haunting. Processed
The sudden scream (was it a scream?) really shooked me. Processed
The VFX reminded me a lot of what Nolan used with Scarecrow, funny enough. Processed
Love how it is it also follows the logic of how the bomb works in that the visuals are the first thing u see followed by the deafening sound, like earlier in the trinity test. Processed
I liked how unambiguously Nolan stated yes, what they did was terrible, celebrating it is terrible, and blood is on everyone’s hands. Processed
It was staggering filmmaking Processed
I like how the cheers slowly become less distinguished and start to sound like the wails of the damned. Processed
The part of that scene where you could hear absolutely every minor detail and sound *except* the clapping and cheering was so abstract and off-putting, never seen anything like it. 

Really helped sell the mind implosion Oppenheimer was experiencing at that moment. I've never seen disassociation done so well in a film before. Processed
All the bombs tested after the trinity test were significantly more powerful.  The first link you posted is set off on or under water so you get a massive outward plume of just pure water vapor.  Also the fireball its self only lasts seconds, onlookers regardless of eye protection would be slightly blinded so the remaining mushroom cloud would probably be quite hard to see in that dark early morning light. Processed
[Here's some footage of the actual Trinity test.](https://youtu.be/wki4hg9Om-k)

The film depicted it quite accurately, and it was dark which really obscures its scale. Perhaps because I was watching in the cropped 70mm format (albeit from 3rd row), but I was also a bit underwhelmed. And while there were some visually stunning shots, most were extremely quick flashes. I don't think enough to warrant a full 70mm IMAX screening. Processed
I was surprised he still stuck up for oppie after getting his communist advances spurned earlier lol Processed
The music was my favorite part of the movie and everything else about the movie was so fucking perfect.

Amazing job from Ludwig Processed
The Geiger counter sounds incorporated into the score were so chilling and cool. Processed
Ludwig has come such a long way since Community and New Girl. The best in the biz. Processed
Listened to “can you hear the music” after the movie at home, I was tearing up. The soundtrack was amazing. Processed
When it was announced that Jack Quaid was playing Feynman, I couldn't wait to see how they would portray him and I was excited for what I'm sure would be some hilarious scenes with him. Turns out, he's barely in the movie and whenever he was, he was just in the background playing bongos. Which is more hilarious, actually. Processed
I think that was important because Jean Tatlock was Oppenheimer's most intimate connection to death and suffering and his own responsibility for inflicting pain on others. So its significant that he read that quote in a scene with her. Processed
I'm in the middle east right now and they put a cgi dress on pugh during those scenes. It was kinda funny. Processed
Nolan heavily implied throughout the film that they would go to any lengths to keep the project going and the secret in tact. Matt Damon talking about Casey Affleck's character in detail hints at this as well. Also they show how Strauss and the FBI were definitely capable of monstrous things. Tossing in JFK at the end is great foreshadowing as well. Processed
I absolutely agree. I thought the scene where they interrogated her might have stolen the movie for me. She had me on a rope. Florence Pugh I thought did fantastic as well. Processed
It's the two opposing characters and their views on where the nuclear program should go. Oppenheimer was content with continuing work on fission projects and didn't want to escalate to fusion weapons. Strauss was all about working on fusion. The whole point of the Kangaroo Court at the end was showing that Oppenheimer was "sabotaging" the fusion program because of possible communist sympathies. The numbering at the beginning was to set up this dynamic and indicate that these two men and their opposing views are what drive the tension at the end. Processed
I really hated him (Roger Robb), which is a testament to how well Jason Clarke played the role. Processed
I loved how he showed the bomb explosion in full silence. 

The movie is loud, very loud. Yet one of the biggest bombs man has ever created goes off. Pure silence. Processed
Saw it last night at a 70mm promo screening.

This scene was jawdroppingly beautiful. Processed
*"We knew the world would not be the same...A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another."*

EDIT: [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqZqfTOxFhY) Processed
Same here, you could hear a pin drop. Might as well have been in the theater by myself Processed
My buddy HATES horror flicks. He just sat and stared at his phone while the trailer was playing and afterwards goes "damn, man, they shouldn't be allowed to do that" lmao Processed
Dawg I don’t do scary movies and especially when they’re creepy children. The final few frames of that trailer are gonna be burned in my mind for awhile Processed
It’s hilarious that one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer had a trailer for that Paul Giamatti movie that’s gonna sell 3 tickets. Processed
And deeply personal and isolating. He seemed so isolated for the most of the film. Processed
I cannot explain how full of anxiety I was when I saw the countdown of the trinity test.

Even after I saw the movie, I can’t imagine how fucking unbelievable is. I mean I’m seeing a visual representation of an atomic bomb but man, in real life, is just unimaginable. Processed
"Hello, this is J. Robert Oppenheimer"

"Oppie I need you now"

"Dr. Oppenheimer isn't here right now, but if you'd like to leave a message..." Processed
That last scene was such a revelation in so many ways. Processed
Every color scene in the movie is subjective, and every black & white scene is objective, as described by Nolan himself. Processed
Kitty explains how vengeful people have the patience of saints and she’s absolutely right. Processed
> "I'm taking Kyoto off the list, due to it's cultural significance to the Japanese people. Also my wife and I honeymooned there."

My theater was jampacked but mostly dead silent excluding reacting to the jarring Exorcist trailer, but this scene made everyone erupt in laughter. We also busted up when Truman is in disbelief with Oppenheimer and says to "get this crybaby outta here" Processed
I had a hard time figuring out Rami's character and why he was even relevant.

It felt like he was in the background for a few minutes then suddenly was key to the whole exoneration.  It just felt weird Processed
I took my son, who is 18. An hour in, I’m thinking OMG  he’s gonna be so bored by this. As soon as it ended, he said ‘that was incredible’….I think all of us are hungry for more intelligent, meaningful and fresh art and culture in our lives. Processed
All hail Christopher Nolan and the IMAX format Processed
I don't think he was that mean to him the first time he didn't want him to take notes on the discussion and took his pen and put it in his pocket.

The second time he didn't want to sign the petition  and accidentally knocked over Dr. Hill's notepad, but he clearly had a remorseful look in his eyes. Processed
Honestly pretty amazing that Nolan could smuggle a twist into a film that’s portraying real life events, but he managed it! Processed
I expected the sabotage to come from the top like politicians and the government itself. But the conflict arising from embarrassing a power hungry person, and a struggle to influence national policy felt more grounded than conspiratorial. Processed
Yeah they did a really good job of explaining the urgency and complexity of things without dwelling on it. All you really needed to know was they were making the bomb at Los Alamos and the bomb material was coming from other places. The story was compartmentalized to Los Alamos, just like the entire project was designed to be. Processed
The marbles also do a good job of showing the passage of time Processed
Also the raindrops rippling the water akin to a barrage of nuclear missles was another clever motif throughout the movie. Processed
That one and the bomb one. I knew the sound wave was coming, but damn did it hit. Processed
For me, the scene in the gym is THE scene of the movie. The way he kept trying to give the speech while reality was breaking down around him felt just like a waking nightmare. The best directing Nolan has done by a country mile. Processed
I don't know what other people's theaters were like but the audience stomping and clapping was the loudest part of the movie for me. Louder than every explosion lol Processed
Most impactful part of the movie, so good Processed
I love how the bit about him destroying someone’s marriage is literally just a throwaway line. Processed
Did you see Einstein walk out of the shadows, literally nick fury lmao Processed
They name dropped JFK like a sequel tease. lol Processed
That guy with the bongos seems like he'd have had an interesting solo movie. Processed
Nolan is teasing us for his new American History Cinematic Universe Processed
It took me a beat or two after it was mentioned in the movie but then I realized the events in this movie drew a direct line to the Bay of Pigs crisis, becoming THE defining event of JFKs presidency. Processed
JFK actually tried to amend the wrong doings that happened to Oppenheimer when he took office. Inviting him to the White House to apologize and awarding him the Enrico Fermi Award which they show in the movie. JFK wasn’t actually able to give the award to Oppenheimer though because he was assassinated prior to it. Lyndon B. Johnson was the one who actually gave the award following JFK’s nomination for Oppenheimer. Processed
if you want you can find HD footage of 1950s nuclear tests on youtube, it really is equal parts awe inspiring and terrifying

That was one of the most interesting parts for me.  I don’t know what I expected when the explosion happened, but it wasn’t dead silence.  In retrospect it makes perfect sense, but in the moment I was left shocked. Processed
Gary Oldman really looked like he was playing Jaime Lee Curtis playing Truman Processed
Wait, was Gary Oldman the one playing Truman? I knew he sounded so familiar. Processed
“Barbenheinner” concept is genius. These two films have more in common than I expected Processed
Is amazing how Einstein was called a crazy man by his own scientific community and then judged the same way as Oppenheimer was. The contrast of the last scene is perfect. Processed
I love how the important moments in the film are broken down in detail, like with the Trinity test. The different perspectives and moments noticed pile on like a unique form of slow motion Processed
I don't know why but every time I saw Einstein it felt like a crossover in an MCU movie Processed
Near the end I kind of figured the last scene would be with Einstein in color, but still... That scene hit me. I was teary eyed. Processed
On the drive home, I wondered for an extremely brief second if the ending would’ve been better with just “maybe they were discussing something more important”. 

Then, I was like nah lol Processed
I think it gets even better when you look at it from Oppenheimer's perspective back at the beginning of the cold war. He has no way of knowing how the cold war played out. From his point of view, the US has their bomb, the Soviets are hot on their heels and nuclear holocaust is all but a few years away; and, you put it all into motion. Horrifying. Processed
That last scene made it a 10/10 for me. Hit me like a train and was so impactful and haunting. Processed
You should've listened to the "do Barbie first" crowd, bro. Processed
We do, its just that most people don't care.  If you look at the work being done today on quantum technologies (quantum computing) and biology its nothing short of incredible.  Its also that we really haven't discovered any new major theories, most of our scientific progress lately has been aplication. Processed
The way I see it is the more stuff we discover the harder it gets to discover more stuff and the more people are necessary to make those breakthroughs happen. One dude just figuring stuff out isn't a thing that can happen anymore. Processed
Truman being offended by Opp's sympathy was spoken verbatim to the real happenings. So cool Processed
[deleted] Processed
This movie had the most middle age + adults I've seen in a theater in YEARS.  Definitely since before the pandemic started...I was impressed Processed
he doesn't penetrate the a-bomb?! wtf did I buy tickets for... Processed
Probably just some random Old Man they found walking around the studio Processed
Truman does have a point though, and this is a dialogue between 2 large egos. He reminded him who’s who there. Great writing. Processed
It's also eerie seeing the two bombs leave Los Alamos, knowing their destination. Processed
During his first panic attack, there was that subtle quick, single woman scream. That was fucking haunting. Processed
Oppy...where's the uranium Processed
The bomb was spherical... **SPHERICAL**! Processed
"Isn't there supposed to be an explosion there?"

"YUP!" Processed

I WHISPERED THIS TO MY WIFE DURING THE MOVIE

The bomb is nuclear…NUCLEAR Processed
The mild surrealism of his anxiety about the victims was so good. Everyone is celebrating and you can't tell what's screaming and what is laughter. There are true surreal images (face melting), but then there's the guy outside throwing up from drinking too much but in that moment representing radiation poisoning. That sequence is stellar. Processed
I laughed and found it a hilarious choice to put the big line in a sex scene but what else is he gonna say?

“It’s Oppin’ time!” Processed
I think that tracks with what actually happened

> At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated "brighter than daytime" for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as "being as hot as an oven" at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over 100 miles (160 km) away, and the mushroom cloud reached 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in height.

The non iMAX 70 mm presentation had two previews, one for the Paul Giamatti movie and one for the new Exorcist. Wasn’t bad, and the projectionist pointed out the Paul Giamatti movie was partially shot in 70 mm. Processed
Einstein was like that in real life. I recommend the book Quantum by Marjit Kumar. Though his greatest achievements were behind him, throughout his career all the greatest scientists in physics still sought Einstein to bounce their ideas off of him and see how he felt. Notice I said how he felt, not what he thought. He was respected for his intuition. He guided other great geniuses, some better mathematicians or simply more intellectually capable than himself, with his intuition. He would say things like ´there is something there´ and that was all they needed. Im talking people like Wolfgang Pauli, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi. Gods of physics. They all wrote him with their latest work, to ask what he thought of the direction they planned to take it. Processed
My favourite part of all Nolan movies is the old sage figures. Nicola Tesla in the Prestige, Alfred in Batman. Processed
I thought the scene surrounding the target list was a dark horse candidate for best scene of the movie. That was when the gravity of the entire thing finally hit me; namely, we are stepping out of the theoretical into the practical, and the world will never be the same. To think that cities were struck or chosen due to honeymoon and culture, is highly unsettling. Then again, is there any “good” way to choose where to drop a nuclear bomb? Processed
I feel like I'm going to do intense reading up on the subject before the second watch so I can get more of the context. Processed
I thought the Sex Scenes were pretty wild and punched hard in an unexpected way. Florence Pugh played her part so well!! Processed
Its not just a movie line.  Its factual.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_L._Stimson

>As Secretary of War, Stimson took direct and personal control of the entire atomic bomb project, with immediate supervision over General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. Both Roosevelt and Truman followed Stimson's advice on every aspect of the bomb, and Stimson overruled military officers when they opposed his views. 
 That is best seen after military planners had selected Kyoto as the most promising target in southern Japan for nuclear attack. Stimson, remembering his honeymoon in that city, once again overruled his generals:

>*Kyoto had been favored for the very first attack but the committee opted to blitz Hiroshima, which was an important army depot and embarkation port within an urban environment. Targets in the south were given priority to boost possible invasion plans but the ancient city of Kyoto was withdrawn because the U.S. Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, who had honeymooned there, said it was an important cultural center and "must not be bombed."* Processed
There were a half dozen hilarious bits that flew over the audience, seemed like no one knew if it was appropriate to laugh. Processed
They didn’t explain it well but they had beef for a few main reasons. 
1. Strauss wanted to develop the H-bomb and nuclear power but oppenheimer refused to support the production of the H-bomb. 
2. Strauss is Jewish and feels like oppenheimer is reducing his Jewish heritage by being an adulterer and not following his religion enough. 
3. Strauss was a notoriously hard-headed guy and unforgiving and oppenheimer making him look stupid in front of the committee hearing pissed him off and he never got over it. Processed
I think the scene with Truman really captured it. Truman dismissed Oppenheimer's guilt as if it was egotistical to assume that he was to blame for the bomb, instead insisting that it was in fact himself that was to blame, but almost in a proud way of it. 

Einstein's comment to Oppenheimer tells him that being considered the pinnacle of a field invites the haters, really. 

Strauss was just a hater. Hell-bent on proving that perhaps Oppenheimer wasn't a paragon. At the end of the day, humans are egotistical and that is just as much a fact of nature as nuclear physics. Processed
Oppenheimer publicly humiliated Strauss and questioned his authority; in the movie Strauss uses his as justification to destroy Oppenheimer's reputation in the eyes of the American people. Processed
A dude behind me was talking about how the Social Network is his favourite movie before the movie started LOL Processed
I’m very glad I had no idea the back bones of this story and came in blind except for the bombings of course. Those reveals and hate was so good and I liked teller, until the end. Processed
It wasn't just you. In a couple of the shots there is what very much appears to be a gloved hand on the back of her head, holding her underwater Processed
[deleted] Processed
Yeah, so many characters and then trying to hear their dialogue was also a problem. I really wish a lot more cinemas would offer closed captions. Processed
I didn’t even pick up on it the first time around but it’s also funny to me the level of involvement in the others takedown. 

Strauss is constantly pulling the strings, masterminding everything to get back at Oppenheimer. But when Strauss goes down we don’t even see Oppenheimer at all. There’s not even any reaction from Oppie or indication he had anything to do with it at all. Kind of plays into the whole thing about Strauss being insecure and thinking everything is about him. Processed
It was extremely fucking loud at my screening. And not entirely predictable, no. Processed
Definitely don't watch in IMAX then, when it's loud it's LOUD Processed
One thing you didn't mention is I thought the moat incredible scene was when Murphy is talking to the board/committee about his affair and Emily blunt is visualizing it in real time. It's an incredible scene because it's so bold and captures what an affair is like for the spouse. Just amazing. I was stunned at how creative it was. I have never seen an affair shot that way. Processed
The Strauss scenes with his counsel felt almost like a different movie, maybe my favorite aspect of the film. Processed
Yeah the third act was so damn thrilling, might be my favorite part Processed
When we first saw Josh Hartnett, sleeves rolled up, bangs in his face, covered in grease, I was just like "you can't be here, you're too hot to be a scientist" Processed
I truly believe Nolan knows his mixes get lost at times and favors the feeling you get when music swells and emotion takes over. I think he picks and chooses what you don’t necessarily need to hear perfectly. There’s no way he misses that. IMO Processed
The Imax near me sucks, the regular rooms have nice big leather reclining seats yet the imax has shitty tiny uncomfortable fabric chairs. I don't get it. Processed
Maybe not for the amount of visuals but I think the IMAX speakers really added to the experience. Processed
Just my own take but along with the babies constantly crying maybe a loss of innocence theme? Processed
I saw it in 70mm Imax and the Shockwave actually made me jump in my seat. I knew it was coming. Like I knew it was coming, I'm not dumb. But it still gave me a jump. Processed
It’s kind of how Einstein was though, especially later in life. He would wander around campus/town deep in thought, lose track of where he was and have to ask random people for directions home. He was also so forgetful, a personal servant was assigned to him to make sure he didn’t leave his suitcase behind wherever he traveled. His random aloofness and silly fashion were totally on-point. Processed
Also the Score, Cillian Murphy, Best Director and RDJ.

But who knows the Oscars can be weird some years. And you just never know what turn up by the years end in terms of films. Processed
It definitely bags the editing award Processed
I laughed at the scene where they say her husband  died of a broken heart about the affair. And oppenheimer says no that’s not true… he never found out Processed
1 was fusion, 2 was fission (or maybe the other way around). They were both displayed pretty close together Processed
I wouldn't call it raunchy, though it is explicit nudity (you see Florence Pugh's breasts during and after sex scenes). But it's reasonably "tasteful", not raunchy and exploitive. Processed
You do not see dong. Processed
I saw that scene as Einstein pondering the weight of what Oppenheimer has just said to him, and Strauss taking it as a sign of disrespect Processed
I saw Strauss’s fixation on Einstein’s silence as an early indication of both his own pride and insecurity. To me, at the time and later with the movie providing the context, Strauss was immediately comparing his own influence and renown to Oppenheimer’s — and his fixation on Einstein was just an extension of that. He thought himself important enough that Oppenheimer would convince Einstein to hate him. He was insecure enough to cling to that moment. I don’t think the isotope humiliation is what made him want revenge in the film, it just confirmed what he’d already convinced himself that day by the pond.

Einstein was just being himself and got pulled into some guy’s bizzaro villain origin story. Processed
Those are the 2 narrative layers. 1. is the color section from Oppenheimers perspective, 2. is the b&w section from RDJs perspective. They run parallel throughout the whole film, that’s why the chapter cards never reappear Processed
I took it as Strauss side of the story (black and white) very Oppie (color) Processed
Jason Clarke plays an asshole so well Processed
I forget the exact phrasing. The judge essentially asked if isotopes were important to the development of nuclear weapons, which RDJ had said very confidently they were. Cillian Murphy responded by saying they were as useful as a cold beer or a sandwich, essentially saying RDJ didn't know what the fuck he was talking about. Processed
JFK was also the president who awarded Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi prize that served as a redemption for Oppenheimer.

JFK got killed before so Lyndon Johnson handed it over but that doesn’t change the fact. Processed
With very few exceptions (e.g., Teller), the vast majority of the scientific community supported Oppenheimer during the security hearing. After Oppenheimer's clearance was revoked, 494 Los Alamos scientists signed a [petition](https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0602-ribes-petition/) that was sent to Eisenhower and the AEC strongly protesting the decision 

>In Los Alamos, the events felt personal. Said Lab Historian Roger Meade, "For the junior scientists, Oppenheimer's treatment caused a visceral reaction, and they felt that the Oppenheimer incident was an attack on science, not just [the man]. The sentiment of the scientists was, 'We're here to do science ... and now they're attacking [the man] that led us here.'

Furthermore, Strauss actually released the full transcripts of the security hearing, basically salting the earth after already destroying Oppenheimer's public career. However, the move backfired and further cemented the opposition in the scientific community against Strauss, as it did amongst his detractors in the Senate. Processed
Same with Rami Malek as well!   


Gary Goldman was incredible. "Don't let that crybaby back in here!" Processed
He spooked me how be just popped up from nowhere at the end like some benadryl shadow entity Processed
Now he has much less influence on nuclear arms regulations. Can't really affect policy making anymore. Processed
The Bkack and White scenes were from the perspective of Lewis Strauss.
When Lewis Strauss is remembering that scene it's in Bkack and White.
Then during the interrogation Oppenheimer also remembers the meeting. And since this time it's from Oppenheimers perspective. It's in color. Processed
You’re not alone.  I wanted a movie about the manhattan project, but i suppose the movie was called Oppenheimer… i had unrealistic expectations i guess Processed
Fully in agreement.

It's not bad at all that the movie tried to explore things beyond the war, including some of what Oppenheimer faced later in his life/career. It's that the movie tried to weave a practically full-length political intrigue drama into a story that already had *so many* other elements and *so many* exposition characters.

It's not that I don't think there is a good story in the whole Strauss situation. There just wasn't enough time to elegantly tell it alongside everything else. Times when I was completely ambivalent to something that was supposed to be impactful:

* When his wife screams "It was Strauss all along!" and threw the glass. Felt so random and the screenplay up to that point did not make that feel natural.
* Malek's testimony
* When Strauss' aide smugly turned against him at the end, also felt so random
* Einstein coming out of the dark in his sweatpants to weigh in
* His wife giving the "clever" testimony that seemingly had no impact on anything whatsoever

I fully believe that with some editing and better writing you could cut out all that political stuff, shorten it way down, and STILL have your cake and eat it too by exploring the scrutiny Oppenheimer faced and his moral dilemmas. Processed
Basically for revenge for earlier percieved slights and in order to use him as a stool to reach a cabinet position, Strauss created scenarios to kill Oppenheimer's career and prey upon his change of heart in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Processed
I wouldn't quite say Nolan was hammering home that idea, these are all true events that transpired and affected Oppenheimer deeply.

The criticism displayed towards Oppenheimer in that hearing was not completely without basis, people around Oppenheimer during his time dabbled in Communism and Soviet spies were indeed discovered in Los Alamos.

Even in one of the "betrayals" during the hearing, Edward Teller, explicitly said that he did not believe Oppenheimer's loyalties are in question, but probably should not be involved in atomic policies and research given his breach of protocol.

I also felt that Robb's point that Oppenheimer' dissenting views on "Super" were inconsistent were also valid - why then he was okay with atomic bombs to begin with? It's not explained in the movie, but I felt that Oppenheimer had personal reasons for that, mainly guilt with how the World is changing due to his work and his wish that it would rather stay unchanged and somewhat familiar to him.

The "top-down" hammering of scientists by politicians was also balanced by "bottom-up" hammering of Strauss by scientists (Hill with his testimony on Strauss' confirmation hearing).

The only thing I felt that Nolan was hammering down was how large and stupid the Red Scare was - you really had to subscribe to the Western dogma and the Western dogma only in order to stay on top in the US. This remains true even to this day. Processed
Teller betrayed Oppenheimer because after the war, Oppenheimer led the opposition at the AEC against development on the hydrogen bomb, Teller's brainchild and #1 priority since Los Alamos. 

Strauss was a petty, vainglorious hardline conservative who deeply distrusted anyone with different beliefs from him and took it as a personal affront when anyone contradicted him directly. The isotopes thing was absolutely one of the reasons why he went after Oppenheimer, because it was a public humiliation from the most prominent scientific mind at the time. But the primary reasons were Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-Bomb and his advocating for nuclear arms control. Processed
He was talking about how everything was composed of atoms drawn together by forces of attraction - is that what you mean? Processed
>I have been hearing from people that it glorifies the entire Atomic Bomb / Hiroshima / Nagasaki thing. 

There is 0% chance anyone saying this have watched the movie. I have a hard time believing anyone could see Oppenheimer and come away with the impression that it glorifies atomic weaponry. Processed
I can’t possibly conceive how anyone could derive “beginning of life” From this movie Processed
That whole scene was the questioner trying to call out Oppenheimer on his hypocrisy. He was shouting at him to pressure him into admitting that he never cared about the horrific consequences of building the atom bomb. Oppenheimer basically admits there that he built it only to be used against the Nazis, but was willfully blind about where it would go after the Nazis lost. 

That whole commission was to smear Oppenheimer's image, so any statement he made to make himself look like a hypocrite would be good enough for them. Processed
it's not about his security clearance, but what the security clearance and trial represent. It's about his loss of control, the inner turmoil he experiences, and his realization that he created a chain reaction that he can't control and how reckless he now realizes that may have been, because he is powerless to stop it. Processed
It was incredibly devastating for him. He felt he served his country loyally for years and was stabbed in the back by the government. It made him unable to work as a nuclear physicist again due to his newfound infamy. He responded by spending most of his remaining time on St John in the US Virgin Islands.

The hearing was seen as a real watershed moment for the scientific community. Oppenheimer attained a degree of public and political influence as a scientist after 1945 that has never been matched before or since in American history. A lot of people consider him to be emblematic of a brief period of technocracy, when the experts were in charge of scientific and technological policy. After his clearance was removed the military was firmly in charge of the nuclear program. 

A lot of scientists took Oppenheimer's treatment by the AEC personally, they felt it was an attack on their expert authority. They saw the trial as not about genuine concerns about security but a plot to diminish the credibility of scientists in the public eye and ostracize them from the policymaking process. Processed
"Then we'll have him killed" made me chuckle. Processed
My favorite Damon line was when oppie was interrupting him about Oppie’s communist beliefs and he’s like, “I said allegedly” very abruptly lmao, idk what it was but that shit flowed so well. Processed
And the two narratives were called fission and fusion. In the H-bomb, a fission reaction is what sets off the fusion reaction. Processed
You can feel it a bit after trinity when Oppenheimer asks if he can come to Washington with the general and he just responds “why?” The government no longer needed Oppenheimer and that little line felt really heavy to me Processed
It works great in contrast to the scene where everything is laid on Oppie's shoulders when Chevalier or Lawrence tells him "you ARE important." Like the weight of that truth just sitting on him and Strauss just almost wishing he had that, meanwhile it's killing Oppie inside. Processed
Strauss was an interesting character, or at least he was portrayed to be very interesting.

His self-important, vindictive nature was evident within the movie, but he is also *completely* correct when he blows his lid to his advisors about how Oppenheimer never once admitted regret for Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that it was also *his* own self interest that made him start objecting. Processed
There's also the fact that Nolan loves to reuse actors he's worked with before.  That 5 min role might lead to a 2 hour role in a future Nolan movie. Processed
And he looked like he could. Processed
Pash is terrifying. Processed
The twist he brings about is incredible. I genuinely didn’t see it coming. Processed
I did too. Just as he went to New Mexico with Emily Blunt. Did I miss any Oppenheimer naked scenes? Processed
They really must have had to go. You knew that scene was happening for a while. Probably for the best, that sound wave would have made them pee a little if they really couldn’t hold it. Processed
Perfectly captured a very real aspect of the American population and system. Men like him armed and trained death squads, got the US into direct partnerships with fascist governments, and killed/ruined untold numbers of people around the globe who even flirted with left wing concepts. Processed
The guy who *earlier* fought the bolsheviks. Processed
Can you elaborate? I remember the ripples on the pond, Tatlock drowning in a bathtub, 10 feet vs 1000 feet, was there anything else? Processed
[deleted] Processed

The bit about him watching the Trinity test through his truck windshield, reasoning that the glass would block the UV light, is also an anecdote he liked to tell. Processed
Played by Jack Quaid, Hughie from The Boys! He gave Richard Feynman energy for sure. Processed
For about five seconds — he’s walking in the woods with Einstein, when Oppenheimer shows up to ask for Einsten’s help. Einstein says that he thinks Gödel is still actively terrified of Hitler. Processed
It’s happening! I’m cumbusting! Processed
After? I thought he was reading it *during* gyrations... Processed
It was kind of ridiculous Processed
Nerds. Processed
Oppenheimer was a total pillow princess, she was trying to find *something* that he’d react to. His silence beforehand is what women talk about when we say men don’t moan enough in bed Processed
that will stick with me for a long time Processed
Yeah, that line was ringing through my ears the whole time he's on trial. 

This whole film really is a struggle between him committing the sin and us feeling sorry for him. I don't think I've ever had such an even mix of animosity and sympathy for a real-life figure on film. Processed
You should see the tv broadcast when he was announcing the bombing. He was LAUGHING Processed
America went from Obama to Trump. We have always been a country of extremes and likely always will be. Processed
I agree with you. I think it’s his magnum opus - almost like only Nolan could make this film. In the moment I noticed several nods to his previous films (football pitch, bomb countdown, blood on face), but I got the feel most from Memento; the shame, contradictions, paranoia, anxiety, ego, isolation and feeling of being lost. In depicting science and mankind’s greatest disaster, he focused deeply on the psyche at the forefront of it; whose art/science imitated his life. This was magnificent beyond compare. Processed
They put the line during a sex scene, which is the sign of a great movie Processed
And that singular leaders have the power to launch them. Like there ain’t even really a true prevention system — would potentially just take a single maniac in a single moment Processed
the first shot was rain on a pond Processed
> Kitty did not give an inch. Not even Robb could touch her. Calm and yet alert to every nuance, she was undoubtedly a better witness than the husband she was defending.

This is exactly how I felt after the scene was finished. Emily Blunt demolished that entire scene as I truly felt Kitty was better at defending her husband than himself. Processed
Kitty embodies bad bitch to a T and it shows.

She dealt Chairman Gray’s bullshit with such grace. Processed
I loved her character. I said it here earlier but she was just there to drink, hate them kids, and to tell Oppy to nut up Processed
Same thing when I saw it today.  There was like a collective sigh of relief when everyone was allowed to move after the sound came back in. Processed
I was so impressed with the lack of reductive narrative. I didn’t come out of the movie hating anyone or having a real hero, just complicated characters. Processed
I could see Nolan tackling the Cold War, where he'll name drop James Bond Processed
Oppenheimer is everything. He's just Ken...nedy. Processed
What did Lebron have to do with it? Processed
Truman meets Churchill Processed
I’d watch the shit out of this Processed
Oh I like this angle. JFK also gave him an award as president to try to rehabilitate him politically Processed
Christopher Nolan presents- The Cuban Missile Crisis. Processed
He has a way-too-familiar voice but I thought he skated his role as well as you could ask him to. “Then we will have him killed” was delivered perfectly. Processed
The Martian is a role where being 'Matt Damon' suited him best. I also think Bourne is \*his\* role where you see him as this brutal efficient spy compared to most of his roles that definitely do feel like "that's Matt Damon". Processed
Damon is the kind of actor who just doesn't disappear into his role. There's always something that remains on the surface layer that reminds you that you are watching Matt Damon the actor acting. And it especially stands out here because this is a film full of recognizable actors who disappear into their characters completely. Processed
For multiple reasons. Alden Ehrinreich’s last line to Strauss was jaw-dropping as well. Processed
Having Rami Malek as the side character everyone brushed off til the end of the movie shows the strength of this casting Processed
I just read it as Oppenheimer thinking about his own hands being apart of it Processed
Matt Damon describing how Casey Affleck’s character was a cold killer felt to me like an implication that her death was orchestrated Processed
Well, not suspected. Theorized that she could have been yes. But all evidence for the most part says otherwise. Processed
I was stoked to see DeHaan on screen. Processed
Wait, THE Rodrick HEFFLEY was in it?? Which one was he? Processed
Definitely hit hard. And the cheering! I was feeling sick to my stomach watching. It really reminded me of a bad trip I had once (where it felt like there was a darkness underneath people celebrating). Processed
I was expecting there to be more screams throughout the speech occasionally, but just having the one had a profound effect Processed
Definitely sounded like the imagined scream of a bomb victim Processed
You know it's memorable because how many movies can you be like "yeah that scream was crazy" and everyone else knows exactly which one you mean, because it struck everyone Processed
That's true. I didn't recall if I had seen that effect in Inception or somewhere else of his, but you are right it was with Scarecrow. Processed
Scientists stick together! They know if it can happen to him, can happen to them.. Processed
Greendale Is Where I Belong is forever GOATed. I love that song and everything it means to me Processed
Oh I think it totally works thematically and how the characters got there. 

But if we knew he literally calls himself the destroyer of worlds in the scene everyone was memeing he would hang dong in, the internet would’ve went *wild*. Processed
Lmao RELEASE THE MIDDLE EAST CUT i gotta see this.

Edit: found a photo of the CGI dress here for anyone curious what it was like: https://twitter.com/baxiabhishek/status/1683352297852510208 Processed
Also: “We’ll have him killed 😃” “Nah I’m just kidding” 

He handled it in a wink wink way for sure, honestly this film’s portrayal of the US government was for sure not positive anyhow though not to conspiracy levels. Processed
Fun fact, with the bunkers being 5 miles away from the bomb it'd take about 25 seconds for the sound to reach them. Processed
Watching this shows me just how much Cillian encapsulated the real Oppenheimer. Processed
it was pretty creepy for a movie trailer in a film like this lol. i liked it but i definitely know some friends who would've felt as wronged as your friend. Processed
I thought I was living in the 80’s Processed
Oppenheimer is very vulnerable in his character which adds to the isolation and anxiety. I find it so poignant yet heart breaking how there's rarely any time for him to repose, he has to constantly deal with stress and tension at every step of the way. Processed
Even more so waiting for the boom. I knew it was coming but still scared the shit out of me lol. Processed
My heart rate was literally going up when the countdown was ticking to its final seconds. Fucking incredible scene. Processed
"Oppie I need you now"

"Not my diagnosis" Processed
And his look of utter betrayal right before he has to put the mask on and go talk to the press. Processed
I think that was done on purpose 

When we see him from Oppenheimer’s perspective, he’s a minor character who serves no reason. But from Strauss’ m perspective, he gets a big role because he’s the one who ruined his hearing. Processed
I think the studios underestimate audiences and their tastes, and I think audiences for a long time have just been willing to go along with whatever studios want to be the biggest, but I think there is a ton of room for different stuff to be received well by a lot of different types of people. Processed
I think this is partly why Succession was such a hit. A modern day Shakespeare that also involved business, finance and politics Processed
I wish they dwelled on the science behind it a *little* more. It's my one complaint with the movie -- we know developing the bomb was this near impossible task, and we know they were racing against the Germans to get it done, but we never really are shown much about the actual discoveries at Los Alamos that got it there. So the whole thing felt more inevitable in the movie than it probably did in real life. Processed
My biggest worry for this film was how it would handle the weight of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and holy shit, the way they did it was so unexpected and brilliant. To only hear about it on the radio, to feel cut out of the loop like Oppenheimer was, and then that gym scene, oh my god. Processed
That scene, the scene when the asshole guy is questioning him and it all goes white and he starts yelling, the Trinity Test, the scene where he feels naked in the room in front of the questioners. Just wow! So good! Processed
And then the dead silence when he disassociates.... Processed
When I heard that and then Strauss started ranting about how egotistical Opp was I was like “I mean yeah he’s right”, dude cheated 3 times and always acted better then most people he talked to. Processed
the scene where he is raising the bongos when the project was successful was equal to cap picking up thor's hammer for me Processed
Bro thank you for sharing that, those were fascinating 

The underwater one was just insane and people in the comments said that was a small bomb,I can’t even imagine a bigger bomb Processed
As soon as he sat back and did Oldman's classic pursed lips look I knew it lol Processed
For one: Horses. Processed
They are both about death and creation. Processed
The burden of genius Processed
I love that the whole movie you think it was because he talked some shit, but then in reality it was because he said something truly haunting. Especially for Einstein given that he truly created the space to some degree. Processed
The funny thing is that modern breakthroughs suggest that Einstein was actually right regarding lots of the things the New Science was criticizing him about in that era before his death. Processed
In the Bird/Sherwij book, they make a bunch of cinematic allusions—notably calling the various recollections of the conversation between Oppenheimer and Chevalier a *Rashomon Effect*.  I love seeing this visualized on screen with the multiple perspectives, as with the Trinity test. Processed
When Einstein walked out of the shadows after the taxi pulled away, I couldnt help but giggle. Like Nick Fury coming over to talk to him about the Avenger's initiative. Processed
I think it has to do with Einstein being one of the few widely recognizable people that the movie shows. Not a lot of famous movies or shows portraying Einstein so despite his being a household name we don’t have a saturation of Einstein performances. So when he appears on screen it gave the same feeling as seeing a crossover superhero movie. 

I think the other really famous person depicted was Harry Truman but that’s about it. The rest are somewhat known in academic/historical circles but you go to any random household in America and they won’t know majority of the real life people being portrayed. Processed
It was really important for me that they convey that these two men destroyed each other because of their self-importance and egos, I'm not sure the entire third act would have worked without it. Processed
My brother's in the "end on Barbie" camp because it'd be more lighthearted and funny (especially with friends and a drink). But given the ending of this AND Barbie's own ending, you're getting a sober ending either way, you might as well commit to Oppenheimer's gut punch. Processed
We manufacture artificial proteins - things that took billions of years to evolve in the wild in just mere months, weeks even. 

No body ever talks about it. Processed
Were the people in this movie especially famous because of the war? Or was there just a generally different attitude towards science/academics in those days? Processed
Yea he really did say that exact thing about oppenheimer. I love also that it ties back to his initial loneliness. They don't show it the movie but he was really bullied as a kid and this scene shows that so well. Processed
That's putting it lightly. Truman called Oppenheimer a pussy who he never wanted to hear from again, lol. Processed
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t know there watch much “writing” needed there.

As far as I understand, a lot of that convo was verbatim. Processed
We spent the whole movie watching these brilliant minds creating these amazing scientific marvels, and then they’re just out of their hands and control, ready to be dropped ASAP. Processed
I took the throwing up as a sign of guilt. All these scientists were heads down for three years unrelenting towards a shared goal only to achieve it, yet the raucous celebration and cheering gave release and in doing so freed the uncomfortable realization that forever more they will harbour this dreadful weight. Processed
Observation posts were 10,000 yards away, which is 9144 meters. Based on the speed of light (300,000,000 m/s) and the speed of sound (343 m/s), the light from the explosion took 0.03 ms to reach them and 26.7 seconds for the sound to reach them. I didn’t time it but I wouldn’t be surprised if Nolan matched that timing near perfectly Processed
I love that the theme of the movie is that they were giving a weapon of massive devestation to humans, not gods. Processed
**Oppie- I am not in charge of pregnancy control in Los alamos sergent.**

*Pregnant Emily Blunt passes by*

**Sergent -Yes I Can see that...**

Film had lots of little quips and jokes that were hilarious Processed
> Strauss is Jewish and feels like oppenheimer is reducing his Jewish heritage by being an adulterer and not following his religion enough

It was a lot more than that. Antisemitism was rampant at the time, especially in American politics. The fact Strauss was able to be as successful as he was while openly embracing being Jewish was a major anomaly of that era, and he thought Oppenheimer was wasting his platform by not doing the same. Processed
Also Strauss had the support of several people that were jealous of Oppenheimer success, building his hate even more. Processed
Strauss was also ultra conservative and Oppenheimer was left leaning Processed
Good memory. I don’t recall your 2nd point, but I believe you. It was hazy about this and then revealed when the Mr. Robot actor brought it all up at the hearing. Processed
Yeah this movie does a good job of conveying the fact that every single important/notable event in history is either the direct results of egotistical thinking or at least massively influenced by the very human desire to protect one's own image of the world. Processed
he fought as a soldier for the White Army against the Reds and lived to see the end of the Soviet Union, crazy Processed
Reminds me of that Chris Hemsworth movie where they slapped glasses on a literal god bod, and said “nah it’s cool he’s a nerd” lmao Processed
He knows about it. He talked about with tenet Processed
Thanks; that's clever. Must be because it keeps jumping forward to the Cold War investigation and back again, so the two parts are labelled early on. Processed
Dude he was such a vital element of this movie. The way he started to unravel a bit and get heated with Opp, simultaneously with the reveal to the audience that he was personally selected by Strauss and perhaps had some skin in the game. Worked so perfectly. Processed
WHERE IS BIN LADEN?! Processed
half the theatre burst out laughing, such was the intensity of the movie Processed
I think that's juxtaposed later by him telling the story of what Casey Affleck had intended to do to one of the scientists Processed
It was when Oppie said he was a “New Deal democrat.” Matt Damon performed those lines beautifully haha Processed
and in the A bomb it’s a “standard bomb” that sets off the fission? Processed
The government did still need Oppenheimer. That’s the whole point of the 2nd half of the movie- they needed Oppenheimer to continue to build from the atom bomb, they wanted him to build the h-bomb etc, but he refused, over moral grounds. Processed
“You aren’t JUST self-important, you ARE important” is such a good line. Processed
I was surprised to see Josh Hartnett having a pretty big role in the movie. I was wondering why and how just because he hasn't been around much. I guess he was one of the candidates for The Dark Knight, but declined. Nolan definitely saw something in him then and put him to good use now. 

Also read somewhere that Matt Damon was supposed to take a break from acting for a while, as a promise to his wife. The only thing that would bring him out of the break would be a Christopher Nolan movie. Guess he never took that break... Processed
No there was no hanging of dong. Just Florence Pugh being topless a few times Processed
The water ripples effect was mimic on the map when they were deciding which city should they bomb. 

I took it that the government was talking about this so casually, this dropping of bombs on populated cities that it was like they talking about raindrops hitting the water. No big deal. And that horrified Oppenheimer. Processed
The opening shot of the film. Processed
I got a chuckle out of that interaction

“The glass will stop the UV rays”

“But what stops the glass?” Processed
I mean gödel would in fact not eat anything from anyone but his wife in fear that he might be poisoned and eventually died Processed
You're both right. It was after round 1 and during round 2 Processed
I agree, coz the real video of Oppenheimer quoting that line was probably the world's first apology video caught on tape

[You can really see it in his eyes, just how much his work is weighing on him, and he is saying "I am become death" with such immense regret](https://youtu.be/lb13ynu3Iac)

Cillian Murphy's piercing eyes truly caught all of this, in the movie Processed
This is really the culmination of everything I like about his movies I think. 

It marries the spectacle and scale of his blockbusters with the more complex, personal emotions of his early movies, and successfully avoids his infamous bad habits like inaudible dialogue and excessive shaky cam. 

It’s like you plucked him right out of his Memento days but gave him a massive budget and an unrivaled cast to play with. Processed
There is a behind the back shot of oppy standing before the bomb tower that was reminiscent of the joker bank heist opening shot Processed
They also used it in the Trinity test which was also really effective. At least, for me. Processed
There are some controls. In the US, for instance, an order to launch has to go through the chairman of the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense. Nixon is supposed to have drunkenly ordered strikes that obviously were not carried out. Processed
For a lot of the movie I was wondering why Nolan cast Emily Blunt as Kitty when she seemed to barely be in the movie. And then I saw that scene and I understood. Processed
That is the scene that gets her nominated. RDJ is going to win for his reveal scene about the same time Processed
> Kitty embodies bad bitch to a T and it shows

bad *drunk* bitch Processed
Emily Blunt’s performance as Kitty reminded me so much of Bloberta Puppington from Moral Orel. Strained relationship with husbands and abhorred their children yet find solace in alcohol.

Kitty and Bloberta would absolutely get along well. Processed
That is the thing that really had me glued. They felt like real people because they were. Nolan & co. really made every character feel alive in a way that films rarely do. Nothing felt dumbed down for the sake of the audience. It respected that the audience would recognize the complexity of who these people really were. Processed
Roger Robb and Lewis Strauss definitely came off villainy Processed
Honestly in an alternate world where these movies didn’t take hundreds of millions to make, that would be a cool concept 

Biopics and historical movies about major events but in the 3rd or 4th movie, you name drop a fictional character/badass to reveal this isn’t historical, it’s a “what if” franchise and you explore how the world would be different with a super spy Processed
Jordan would have never given Oppenheimer the award Processed
With Gary Oldman playing both Processed
Ngl, I'd watch the shit out of that Processed
If we're talking about familiar voice. Casey Affleck for me, they did a long sequence of not showing his face to give a tense reveal of who this mystery guy was. But all I was thinking about was "that's definitely Casey Affleck" Processed
Alden's performance is going to be overshadowed by a cast full of amazing performances, but he was such an excellent audience surrogate for the Strauss side of the story. Most of his arc is conveyed through his facial reactions, and it just perfectly captures the evolving perception the audience has of Strauss. Really great character.

EDIT: Upon reflection, I see a lot of similarities between Alden's character and the character of Rev. Hale from The Crucible. Both are introduced as by-the-numbers pencil pushers who are on the antagonistic side more out of circumstance than anything else, but they're gradually disillusioned by the system over the course of the story and land as one of the few morally agreeable characters. It may just be the strong presence of McCarthyism in both stories, but I see a lot of similarities between the two works. Processed
I kept wondering to myself “Did they really cast Rami Malek to be in two scenes with no dialogue and just drop a clipboard in a hotel lobby?” Processed
That guy gave me the f'kin creeps. And yes, that cut with the hands was definitely alluding to the earlier conversation between Matt Damons character and Oppenheimer, where he mentions Casey is unhinged and... tying no loose ends. Processed
He was one of the scientists along with Josh Peck and Jack Quaid, he only had like 2 speaking scenes though Processed
Sounded like a child, too.

Devastating, and made me remain on alert in case there were more - primal instincts kicking in to pick it out and tell where it was coming from, but there were none. One scream and gone. Processed
Haunted me more than actually showing Hiroshima/Nagasaki since he wasn’t physically there and it’s all his POV Processed
Honestly I was surprised to see how popular a movie it is here. My showing and the next two showings after mine were sold out. As I was heading in a group of teenage girls were by in their tickets for the last showing of the night. Processed
They put CGI dress here in India too. I think they did it for every country with strict censor guideliness regarding public movies Processed
Now I need to go rewatch it and see exactly how many seconds elapse between the silence and shockwave hitting them. Processed
He does! I’m amazed how Cillian looks almost like Oppenheimer to a striking degree, he captured the solemn and stoic demeanor of him nicely. Processed
Isn't it pretty common to show trailers for rated R movies at movies that are rated R? I can't remember the last time I saw a rated R movie in theaters where there *wasn't* a horror movie trailer (as those are often rated R). Processed
yeah it took so long i started to forget about it and then **BOOM** Processed
Especially because people are being more selective with their movies choices in theaters post-pandemic. If a movie looks safe and the reviews were meh then people are likely to stay home. People want to see directors taking risks like in Oppenheimer. Processed
And the science is honestly the fun part. It is ridiculously difficult to enrich uranium, and they had to use an extremely inefficient method to separate it, using a repurposed mass spectrometer.

It was akin to separating grains of rice from wheat by hand. Except that they had a LOT of hands to assist. Processed
I might be wrong, but my understanding ia that, until John Hersey's book was published, everyone outside of Japan was out of the loop. No one really had any concrete idea of what the immediate bodily impact and long term devastation would be Processed
The sex scene in the hearing room felt like a horror movie. Processed
Did anyone else catch the high pitch scream that lingered for a fraction of a second longer before he disassociated? Like the scream of a woman in pain? That was absolutely terrifying to me. Processed
I’m glad Nolan and Murphy portrayed him as a flawed man, not a good or a bad man. Processed
This aspect is fascinating! You dislike Strauss cause he's a conniving politician hellbent on petty vengeance... But he's not entirely wrong about Oppenheimer lmao. Processed
> I can’t even imagine a bigger bomb

The underwater Hardtack was 8 Kilotons.  As in equivalent to 8,000 tonnes of TNT.  

Russia's latest ICBM that only came into service *last year* can carry warheads that are estimated to be between 18-25 Megatons per warhead.  A Megaton is a thousand times larger than a Kiloton so using the lower end estimate of 18 Megatons, one warhead is *two thousand two hundred fifty* times the size of Hardtack.  And that single ICBM can carry **10** warheads that can each bomb a different target over a 150-200 miles range.

...knowing a shit load about military arms made the last line of the movie hit hard. Processed
Two: Death and existential crisis Processed
Existential dread and deep feelings of anxiety. Processed
Signified by his hat blowing off and Oppenheimer picking it up. Processed
ELI5 why Einstein was sort of a pariah / criticized at that time?  My education taught me that Einstein pioneered the theory of relativity and is "THE" greatest scientist along with Isaac Newton. Processed
you think you're the only super physicist in the world? Processed
We are also all very familiar with Heisenberg Processed
A lot of discoveries and breakthroughs were more "basic" so to say because quantum mechanics as a field was so young that any progress seemed huge. For example, Dirac's PhD thesis concerns things taught at an undergraduate level today. So everyone who discovered something had their work built upon by exponentially more people and thus got more famous than scientists of today (until we experience some sort of new field where individuals contribute, not teams) Processed
Something people can't really fathom is just how much everything changed in the first half of the 20th century. all the theoretical physics that they show/allude to/reference in this film was a shift in science that never happened before and probably won't ever happen again - all the technology we have today works because they -did- solve so much of the puzzle, they figured out what the rules and math behind physical reality are Processed
It seemed like it was supposed to be ambiguous to me.

The scene before showed a big celebration with people kissing and drinking. It also showed the one woman celebrating and a second later crying in horror. I think it was supposed to show his anxiety and inability to properly process the world around him.

The throwing up is open to interpretation Processed
This is why Strauss' introduction threw me off. He corrects Oppenheimer to use an Americanised (or at least altered) pronunciation of 'Strauss' and Oppenheimer remarks either way everyone knows you're Jewish, which suggests Strauss is downplaying his Jewishness and perhaps resenting Oppenheimer for being so loud about it, but that doesn't track historically. Processed
I couldn’t tell if opp’s fame was understated or overstated for this point of the plot Processed
Depends on the bomb. Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was literally a gun that shot a uranium bullet at a block of uranium. Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, was the implosion type bomb that we saw tested in the movie at the Trinity test. Interestingly, the gun bomb hadn’t been tested but was the first bomb dropped, they just assumed it would work. Processed
What even did the security clearance entail? That seemed the biggest thing Processed
I didn't know who it was (now I do) and I kept thinking 'wow this Lawrence guy is really pretty' Processed
I was confused about Hartnett as well when the cast was originally announced and he had a pretty significant role, but my confusion went away a few weeks ago when I saw the new season of black mirror. He killed it in his episode Processed
The fact that they crossed off a city because “my wife and I honeymooned there” was mind-boggling Processed
It should of been the ender after they said it was based on the book. Processed
That scene’s so fucking great. The tension and build up as they count down makes you anxious as fuck, then when it finally goes off, silence. You just have to sit there in awe and horror as you watch what these men (and woman) made, and just as it’s sinking in, you get the line:

“Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds.”

And by then when you’ve finally let your guard down, that’s when the loud ass explosion from the IMAX speakers knock you on your ass even more.

Just an amazing scene Processed
TRULY! For some reason I couldn’t get behind her character until THAT scene, and then everything made sense Processed
Nah, it's the scene when she murders Teller with one look ;) Processed
I didn’t know anyone could make Casey Affleck terrifying, but goddamn Nolan did it. Processed
Casey Affleck jump scare Processed
So were they trying to hint that Aiden was the one who leaked the information against Strauss? He seemed real happy when Rami Malek's character revealed confidential information about Strauss's involvement. But I wasn't sure if I'm misremembering it Processed
“You lied to Boris Pash? That man has killed Communists with his bare hands.” Processed
When he steps on the imagined charred body of a bomb victim after he made the speech, it send chills down my spine. Processed
Felt longer than 25 seconds but my anxiety was at the highest at that moment so it might actually be 25secs and my brain slow everything down Processed
>And the science is honestly the fun part.

I think that's exactly why we don't see any of the problem-solving that happened during Manhattan Project. Nolan doesn't want us to feel admiration; his main goal in the movie is to explore Oppenheimer's guilt and the morality of his research, so it serves him better to keep the process itself shrouded in mystery. Processed
That's very true, but  I like how the film also used it to demonstrate Oppenheimer's immediate loss of control over the situation as soon as the bomb was finished. Also with the army guy saying "we'll take it from here" when he tried to advise him on how high to drop the bomb from, or his final conversation with Grove saying he will keep him informed "as best we can" Processed
yeah, the whole auditorium scene was haunting. With the fallout, the nuclear flash, the skin pealing off the woman, and the burnt up body. Nolan really showed the horror of nuclear weapons Processed
Wow great point! Processed
Einstein was renowned for his development of special and general relativity, as well as other developments in statistical mechanics and the photoelectric effect. While his paper on the photoelectric effect was important to the development of quantum mechanics, it took him awhile to accept the conclusions of later developments in QM as the theory became more developed. Thus for awhile in the 30's and 40's he was seen as being behind the times.

It's also perhaps worth mentioning that his political views and in particular his critique of capitalism did not endear him to the US government, so some of his diminished reputation may have been retaliatory. Processed
Look up the Einstein-Bohr debates: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2

Basically, Einstein heavily criticized what has come to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physicists that Neil Bohr and most physicists took as the conclusive interpretation of reality. This was taken by the younger scientists as a sign that Einstein himself had become outdated and out of touch with their modern sensibilities and CI became the leading theory for the next sixty or so years. 

In the last twenty or so years however there has been a lot more criticism of the CI now that the original young scientists of that era are now old men and dying off, and a new appreciation for Einstein's criticism. It also helps that several additional theories of Einstein which were non-provable with the technology of the time have now proven correct, especially regarding black holes and gravity waves. Processed
also the german actor playing heisenberg is like known in germany but you wouldnt think he would star in such a movie. seeing him in a nolan film with that cast around him felt like I seeing a guy I went to school with having sex with margot robbie like „NO WAY he pulled that off!“. Processed
America knows the *other* Heisenberg Processed
Exactly. Otto and Lenoir are solidified in history because of their developments and contributions to the discovery of the combustion engine. Nobody is getting any recognition today for improving the thermal efficiency of combustion engines from 20% to 25%, which is arguably a much harder task Processed
I’m not sure, he was actually on time magazine tho so Processed
I think the fame was actually fairly accurate. Weirdly I don’t think the film even fully captured his intelligence, there’s a handful of Nobel prize winners that consider him the smartest man to have ever lived. Processed
Surprised this wasn't explained in the film Processed
[deleted] Processed
Felt as if I was physically assaulted watching it in IMAX when the sound wave hits Processed
I wish she had had a better introduction in the movie so that her character didn't seem so wasted up till that point Processed
I read from Vulture that Teller cried IRL when Kitty did not shake his hand. Processed
"Was that a Japanese soldier? Or an innocent child?"

The thought that you couldn't tell and it's just ash in the end was terrifying Processed
It was definitely slower than 25 seconds but they also showed the pov of many different characters during that explosion. Processed
"They need us."

"Until they don't." Processed
Oppenheimer, we need to cook Processed
And back then, that was truly like getting anointed "most famous person currently in America". TIME had weight back then in a way that no magazine does nowadays Processed
They talk about it a bit when discussing detonation ideas. One guy mentions this, and another chimes in excitingly that he wants to look more into that idea. Processed
Feels like this should have been pointed out in the movie.

I took as mostly a way to discredit him to the eyes of the public by removing his security clearance. Processed
now i am become deaf Processed
I thought the same at first until I realized that the way she was portrayed throughout the film up to that point was supposed to make us underestimate her. We needed to be as surprised as Robb (and Oppie’s lawyer) that she had that serrated edge to her. Processed
I think that was the point. It highlighted the sexism of that world.

Remember how she was first introduced…? She had a degree and a husband, but ended up gaining the eye of a powerful man and she immediately seized the opportunity to be with someone she actually loved and not out of familial obligation.

The hints were there that she was powerful, intelligent, and fierce from the beginning… but they purposefully didn’t show much of that until the end.

She had the fight in her the whole time. Processed
They also give you a frame of reference that the experienced time is being slowed down. The whole 10 to Zero takes far longer than 10 actual seconds. Processed
Yeah I feel like this movie had a huge problem where the stakes of the narrative were not really highlighted by the filmmaking which made it hard to understand why some things were being shown. Processed
